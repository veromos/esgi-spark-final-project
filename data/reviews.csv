271781,bluejacket74,2017-03-17,"   750 ml bottle, 2016 vintage, bottle #304 of 360. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like dark fruit (raisin, plum), chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of licorice. For the most part I think the taste is just like the aroma, but with some coffee flavor noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, worth picking up if you want a nice straight forward imperial stout. Here's hoping Four String brings this back in the future! $9.99 a bottle.  ",4,4,4,4.25,4,4.03

125646,GratefulBeerGuy,2017-12-20,"   0% 16 oz can. Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: ""Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose"" A white haze to the yellow and golden liquid. Thick and healthy, totally unfiltered. Brawny white foam cap, thick, all-white clumps. Huge lacing left over. The aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect, mellon and mango, grainy earthiness, tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect, then a peppery kick at the end. Very aromatic. The flavor is just bursting with complex hops, zesty earthy tones, sweet orange, peppery malt, clean fresh feel and overall vibe. A crispy bite wakes you up, full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered expereince. The feel and flavor finishes with a fun, earthy, zesty dry bite. Tropical juicy, zesty citrus, zippy golden wheat malt, melons, rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well. Levels of complexity are deep. It's an interesting ride for sure. Overall, this one stands somewhere near the top of the New England IPA's.  ",4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.58

125646,MFMB,2017-12-16,"   Pours a creamy opaque light straw yellow with a whispy frothy white head. Nose is of citrus skin and light pine. Taste is a thing of beauty! A nice citrus punch in the mouth. Both peeland zest as well as juice of oranges, grapefruit and lemon. Nice malt backbone although minimal presence, you know its there because the hoppyness of this beer is perfectly balanced. Meadium creamy body. Smooth to drink. Finishes with with a Nice pungent citrus bitterness that leaves you craving the next sip to start the process over again. By far my favorite Treehouse brew of the 4 or 5 I’ve had.  ",4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.52

This unique brown pours a deep muddy blackish brown with an excellent head of dark tan foam that subsides to a thick ring, modest pool, and features some nice sudsy lacing. Nose of coconut milk, cocoa, and light cola notes. Flavors lightly exceed the nose with deeply roasted coconut with dark cola and cocoa flavors with a touch of chicory note to it on the rear of the taste. Nice mouth feel; coating, medium carbonation, medium body, and a bitter malt finish with just of touch of herbal hops. Overall it is a nice unique little brew. Cheers  ",4,3.75,4,3.75,4,3.92

Sweet with plenty of coconut and cocoa, but with something different..a twist. There’s also a spiciness, like chicory in there…like a root beer spice. This one is really packed with deep flavor, rich and unusual. Not your father’s coconut brown ale, yes. Delicious, for sure!  ",3.5,4,4.25,4,4,4.07

150672,byronic,2016-04-14,   Poured a bit lively and had to wait for it to settle very nice lacing. Slightly hazy golden straw. Floral notes maybe a hint of citrus. Quite smooth on the palate a touch bitter and definitely a pungent finish as advertised. Somewhat of a dry finish and something about the lingering taste is off. The mouth coating is a touch creamy.  ,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75

150672,KingHoppy,2015-08-14,"   Passing through Swift Current SK, I stopped at Original Joe's for a late night meal. Many times previously, they had no IPAs whatsoever so I almost didn't ask but when I did, I was pleasantly surprised they were now carrying the hometown craft beer IPA! by Black Bridge Brewery. Notes of citrus, pine, floral, everything you could want in an IPA and with a respectable 7% alcohol kick as well. Very well balanced with the malt. Immediately it was one of my favorite American style IPAs. The next day I went to the Swift Current liquor store and bought three 4-packs. I haven't seen it outside of Swift Current, SK but since it's a new brewery they will surely expand to other locations. If you're passing through Swift Current, you got to try this beer - otherwise keep your eyes open for it in your local beer store.  ",4,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.28

150672,biboergosum,2014-12-26,"   355ml can, the latest from this nascent craft brewery from Swift Current, Saskabush. This beer pours a clear, medium copper amber hue, with four flabby fingers of puffy, rocky, and somewhat bubbly bone-white head, which leaves some exploded bike chain lace around the glass as things quickly subside. It smells of pungent, and sort of dank piney, leafy hops straight off, with a strong pithy orange, white grapefruit, and lemon rind citrus fruit abettor, some chalky flintiness, and a middling grainy caramel malt sweetness. The taste is gritty, grainy pale and semi-sweet caramel malt, a muddled green forest floor detritus bitterness, musty orange, lemon, and pineapple citrus notes, a still persistent earthy flintiness, and the suggestion of a hint of a wisp of metallic warming alcohol. The carbonation is fairly peppy and engaging in its low-key fizzy and outright frothy nature, the body an adequate medium weight, and more or less smooth, the hops displaying some down-home hospitality, they are. It finishes off-dry, the malt not ready to cede the flag just yet, while the hops start a campaign to consider a plan to circle the wagons. A pleasantly rendered, high-octane IPA, the hops more prevalent up top, but that's ok, the beer overall doesn't lag as a result, like some. Anyways, nice to see another well made local-ish IPA, and in cans to boot - hope to see this still around next summer, when I finally try to get back out camping, toddler in tow.  ",3.75,4.25,4,3.75,3.75,3.97

Smell has some decadent rich caramel and toffee aromas along with a bourbon soaked raisin sweet aroma and lightly tart dark red cherry aroma.Tons of vanilla tannins and barrel notes are balanced along side some light roasted marshmellow, and bourbon notes. Taste follows the nose with a big caramel and toffee sweetness hitting the palat first along side some fig and date flavors. Loads of vanilla tannin and toasted marshmellow come out along with some oak barrel and bourbon flavors,roasted malt, a walnut like nutty flavor and moderate amounts alcohol in the finish.

104824,kevanb,2014-05-24,"   12oz bottle poured into a Pipeworks snifter. The beer pours a jet black color and has extreme opacity with a very thick texture. A thin but taut khaki head rises that has decent retention and leaves some spotted lace behind. The aroma is wonderful, plenty of vanilla bean, lots of toasted coconut, lots of earthy wood with light bourbon, chocolate is bittersweet and brings out both a light roast quality and some hazelnuts. It's very complex but easily approachable and inviting. The flavors are just as impressive, massive coconut presence with some strong vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, bourbon, charred wood with a bit of chalkiness in small doses. The body is a bit lighter than I expected, very silky and it coats the mouth well while the finish is delicate and smooth. Verdict: An absolute stunner from Pipeworks. A textbook example of improving upon a base beer using barrels, adds not only complexity but depth. The balance of flavors is wonderful, everything in harmony, both sweet and earthy. This is easily my favorite Pipeworks beer to date and a remarkably good stout.  ",4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.45

74580,grogged,2012-05-15,"   On tap at the Red Lion Grog House. Served in 16 oz glass w/ Fountain Square Brewing logo. Pours a deep brown with a creamy tan head that looks delicious. The smell was fragrant, almost earthy, yet slight off. Roasted coffee comes to mind, but there's an industrial whiff to it also. The mouthfeel is different. The carbonation stands out noticeably and not for the better. Full, yet fizzy and inconsistent. The coffee taste comes to the fore and so does the bitterness. The problem I had with this beer is that the bad carbonation notes and the bitterness linger too long in the brut(al) finish. I can love a beer that's slightly off, but this one was too far off for me. A drain pour.  ",3.5,3,2,2,2.5,2.43
74580,aasher,2012-02-08,"   On draft at McKenzie River off of 82nd St. This arrived a medium bodied coca brown in color on the verge of black with a one finger cream colored head. The nose features slight coffee, slight dark chocolate, and bitter roast. It solid, more bitterness than most. The flavors feature coffee and cream first and foremost. The chocolate is light subtly sweet. It finishes off dry and bitter. It drinks smoothly and between light and medium in body. Overall this is a solid beer and a nice first experience from this brewer. I'll try more of their beers in the future.  ",4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.58
58482,Imstillthegman,2009-08-17,"   This one pours a cloudy rusty orange with about a fingers worth of off-white head. The head quickly faded to a ring, but left nice lacing. The aroma is a basic version of what I had hoped for. Sweet fruit and candi sugar with a bit of peppery yeast and a herbal/floral hop note. Not bad, just doesn't wow me. The flavor is quite enjoyable. I get the yeast right up front quickly followed by the sugars and fruit (pear and apple). The yeast comes back into play again with a nice pepper bite before I get the earthy hops. Active carbonation keeps the flavor going after the swallow. Not too bitter, more dry and white peppery. Very enjoyable brew that I will pick up again.  ",4,3.5,4,4,4.5,3.98
205644,Jaypeajus,2016-06-08,"   Not sure what to expect except I look forward to coconut..looks ok, not much head retention, much darker than brown, but I'm new to brown ales. First smell is like a smokey bock, whiffs of chocolate, tastes of charred chocolate cinnamon burnt banana slight mintyness, smokehouse flavors but not much of any coconut to me, bummed a bit about that. Feel is viscous not much in the hop register leaves a smokey residue on the tongue and mouth. Overall pretty complex very drinkable but no coconut and I only bring it up cos the label says it. Oh it does say toasted coconut so maybe that's all the smokiness. First burn em brew and it was good.  ",4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.66

Nice aroma, possibly the best part of the beer, good irish malt feel, bourbon and oak plenty strong but not overly done. Smooth taste, relatively easy drinking, good bourbon delivery vessel. Mild roasted malt notes, dark fruit way in the back, not overripe, not bitter, pretty smooth, carbonation spot on. Good stuff, nice use of barrel in this one.  ",3.25,4.25,4,4,4,4.02

T: Dark fruit, light bourbon, malty, sweet with little to no hop flavor. F: A little lighter than I was hoping, but the base beer isn't very heavy (heh) in the first place.

174137,JerzDevl2000,2017-06-08,"   11 1/2 years on here and never did I review a beer in a crowler, until today. Someone I trade with got me this a while back and I finally got around to cracking this 32 oz'er down on this cool morning. I'll give any brewery in my home state a go and for a first impression, this wasn't that bad. Not much information was given on the can except that Village Idiot was located in Mount Holly and that the ABV was 6.8%, and not the 6.5% listed on here... Nice pour to this, as the beer had a deep and hazy golden hue to it, with plenty of head on top to boot. Deep rings of soapy lacing were left behind as the head had a nice retention as I worked my way through this. Not a strong aroma to this but there was a good amount of honey sweetness present to draw me in. Metallic hops, citrus pith, and a grassy undertone all combined for an unusual, but relatively pleasing taste that was pretty full while making this beer seem more like a balanced Pale Ale than an IPA. A low amount of carbonation, spicy malt presence like bread, and medium body kept this from feeling too heavy though this could have been a bit more balanced! Just the right amount of alcohol in here given the massive size of this. Nice job on this beer as I'm intrigued as to what else these guys are capable of. Time to start canning and getting more New Jersey breweries onto the proverbial map!  ",4.25,3.5,4,4.25,4,3.92

58482,Kadonny,2009-08-17,"   Poured from a bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. A: A nice cloudy gold color with a nice one finger white fluffy head. Nice glass lacing. S: Sweet fruits with some candy sweetness and a nice floral hop smell. Not overly complex, but nice. T: Sweeter fruits start first with hints of pear, apple, orange followed by a deep candy sweetness and maybe some bubblegum. A nice yeasty spicy funk is tasted and then you get this massive hop hit. Tastes of floral spicy earthy hops linger at the finish and leave a nice bitterness. Not overly complex again, but very nice. M: Medium and coating with some prickly aspects. Nice lingering bitterness. D: High, these are really drinkable, and the abv is totally hidden. Overall this beer is a tweener to me, but a perfect tweener. It's hoppier than a BPA, but not as hoppy as a Belgian IPA. It really is a great beer that is really enjoyable. Dan, this beer is wonderful, I love it. If you brew it regularly, I will buy it. A damn fine beer that is a nice mix between a Belgian and an American that is very enjoyable and drinkable. Good stuff!  ",4,4,4,4,4.5,4.1

58482,jamie2dope,2009-08-16,"   Here we go again, another brew from Weyerbacher. This one is a Belgian Pale, which is a hit or miss style for me. Clear orange in color, with a decent amount of white head. Lots of bubbles are racing to the top of this beer. Musty smells start things off and stay throughout, with traces of fruit thrown in here and there. More phenols in the taste, along with some grapefruit-esq hops, and a dry finish. Medium bodied, this is one crisp and refreshing Belgian beer. Drinking it is pretty damn easy too. Here we have another winner from Weyerbacher. Keep up the good work guys.  ",3.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.85
58482,dogfishandi,2009-08-10,"   MY 100TH REVIEW kinda wish i couldve had a little better beer than this for the 100th, but the next 2 should make up for it. pours a hazy glowing orange amber color. big fluffy head, almost pure white faded to a ring half way through the glass. just a touch of lacing. in the aroma your hit with big bubblegum and bananna from the yeast, some spiciness, floralness, from the hops i imagine. the aroma almost reminds me of the flouride u used to get from the dentist when you were a kid. for the taste you get some of the belgian yeast character, flouride taste, and then you get a lot of american hops. the 2 flavors combined create a kind of spiciness, almost peppery if you will. finishs a dry bitter spicy flavor that lingers. seems more like a belgian APA. doesnt seem to have the soft fluffy goodness of the true belgian PAs. for this i go down in the score a little, still a very good beer. smooth mouthfeel, medium body. good carb. but just not the same as an authentic belgian. good drinkability.  ",4,4,3.5,4,4,3.8
58482,DanielClouser,2009-08-09,"   I recently thought about the idea of toning down the bold new Belgian IPA style to a Belgian APA. I think Weyerbacher had the same idea, and Zotten is the result, as it is not consistent with the classic BPA style. Overall, it was very successful, but there was a pervasive grassy sort of bitterness in the flavor that really hurt the brew (especially its drinkability). I think maybe the hops variety used and/or how much is used for bittering should be re-evaluated for this beer, as it otherwise has potential to be excellent.  ",4,4,3,4,2.5,3.3
58482,Patrick999,2009-08-06,"   Pours an attractive shiny pale copper, like a penny. Copious bubblegum in the nose, some clove. I thought it was an impressive strong aroma. Nice flavor, a Belgian pale with much of the sweet bubblegum flavor, cut with a dose of citrusy American hops. A flavorful little beer. It doesn't feel as light and pillowy as a from-Belgium Belgian pale, but few American interpretations of the style do. Good beer. I wasn't prepared to like it as much as I do.  ",3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.04
58482,JohnQVegas,2009-08-05,"   Bottle into Sam Adams Lager glass. Pours a hazy bright copper, just a bit on the dark side, with a thin, fizzy off-white head that disappears pretty quickly. Nose is nice - tangy tropical fruit and spices (coriander?), c-hops come though citrusy and pungent. Yeast comes through tangy and just a bit peppery. I like this one, though the northwestern hops tend to steal the show just a bit - they could be toned back a tad. Or at least made cleaner, their pungency is what's holding this one back. Taste carries more notes of lightly pungent c-hops, citrus and tropical fruit, big and spicy yeast note, peppery even. Light to moderate bitterness towards the finish that carries with the peppery, spicy note on the finish. Interesting, but the c-hops really take an overly heavy hand with this one in my opinion - give me a Belgian pale with grassy noble hops any day of the week. Not as subtle as I'd like it to be, but still pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is ok. The hops are laid on a little thick and rob the beer of the lightness I was hoping for, the body being a bit full as a result. Not as dry as I was hoping for either. Drinkability is pretty nice. When they say Belgian Pale Ale, I think they mean, Belgian-influenced American Pale Ale, not Belgian Pale Ale as in the traditional Belgian style. At least that's my take on it anyway. Still, not exactly what I would call a resounding success - not every style is made better with a big punch of American hops. Leads me to wonder what a classic like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which isn't quite as heavy handed with the hops, would do with such a treatment. Compared to the classics of the style like Orval, though, this one isn't even close.  ",3.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.92
58482,wiseguy142,2009-07-30,"   Pretty good looking. Amazing viscous head, lasts a while with some quickly dried up foamy lacing. Not a big fan of the color.. sort of a stereotypical beer color but there's nothing wrong iwth it. The aroma is almost too much for my 1 unclogged nostril to handle. Sort of a pungent Belgian smell. I'm not a huge Belgian fan in general and it comes off to me as smelling like bleach. Otherwise very floral to sort of an extreme, like smelling a scented candle. The taste again follows the bleachy smell. Maybe I'm sensitive to this because some of my early homebrews had problems with phenols, but this is a phenol phuck phest. Sweet and tart around the edges with a hint of alcohol. You can tell the beer is bottle conditioned because it feels a bit foamy immediately when it enters your mouth. Drinkability not so much. I'm having trouble finishing this. I don't think it's bad per say. I read in BA mag that some people were claiming it's too young and I think I tend to agree. Never been a big fan of Belgian Pale Ales in the first place- the Belgians I really like are the Strong Dark Ales but I wanted to try this out. I'm going to save the rest of the 4-pack for a few months and try again.  ",3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.05

58482,TurtleCove,2009-07-25,"   12oz bottle bought as part of a mix pack from local beer distributor. Poured into a Duvel tulip, great looking beer. Deep golden honey brown, expected cloudiness from lees. Three finger white head, fine bubbles, subsides slowly to good lacing. Smell is as expected from a Belgian style pale ale, yeast, spice and citrus, maybe a hint of melon and banana too. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth and almost creamy form the fine carbonation. Taste, like smell, is as expected from a Belgian style pale ale with great yeast and a slight hoppy finish. One interesting, and very pleasant, flavor note is a slight herby flavor reminiscent of fresh dill. Eminently drinkable.  ",4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.42
58482,callmemickey,2009-07-25,"   A: Murky pale orange-amber body. Moderate offwhite cap, little lacing... Not as robust as I expect from the style. S: Mild candied sugars, banana and yeast. Soft and rounded. T: More of the same. Pleasant, if not bland. Lacking in the depth to elevate to the next level. Mostly breaded malts and soft banana / yeast notes. M: Smooth. Clean finish. D: Easy drinking... overall the beer falters from its lack of sophistication and assertiveness... a solid beer nonetheless.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.65
58482,techcommdood,2009-07-24,"   Pours a hazy dirty gold color with quite a bit of head (2+ fingers), and quickly reduces to a thin layer of light foam at the surface. Moderate lacing on the glass. A bit of a funky color, almost like 50/50 lemonade/iced tea. Strong malty nose with coriander, citrus, and peppercorn. Slight wildflower notes. Dry hoppy taste with malted barley, citrus zest, coriander, and a touch of black pepper. Mouthfeel is surprisingly mellow and juicy at first, but turns to dryness afterward. About average drinkability on this one. Overall, a good session ale.  ",3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.52

S- Fruit, bubblegum, spice, sugar, and bananas. Mild in aroma. T- Taste is much more powerful than the aroma would have you think. Tart fruit right away, then a mild sweetness with spice follows to tone it down. This is quickly followed by an unexpected bitter hop bite. The aftertaste wavers between bitter, sweet, and astringent. M- Medium in body and well carbonated. Finish is clean but unusual with the lingering bittersweet tastes. D- Alcohol is well hidden and at 6% ABV it is pretty drinkable. I'm not sure if I would be able to session this one though. Tastes a little out of balance and not as smooth as I would expect a Belgian style to be. The finish is the flaw for me. Worth trying.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.38

Pours an interesting pale orange hue, a bit like me when I've been out in the sun too long. A pass of the glass beneath my ass (nose) yields an interesting amalgam of the wheatiness of a hefe & the yeastiness of a Belgian. Interesting beer. The taste is a perfect mirror of the smell: Belgian candy & yeast, with a grassy, wheatishness that would be comfy in a hefe. Beneath the surface there are some summer fruits, & spices, maybe a bit of banana & cinnamon or something to contribute some depth & interest. Tart & dry on the tongue, with a mid-July taste that begs for a lawn chair & a copy of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"". Very good brew. Glad to have tried another Weyerbacher experiment, & a successful one at that. Start sending some of these north!  ",4,4,4,3.5,4,3.95

58482,cvstrickland,2009-07-14,"   Zotten pours brightly clear and brassy golden in color with a finger's thickness of grainy white foam atop. Steady streamers feed a slumping bubble-cap that retains at a thick sheet and deposits sliding lacing onto the sides of my shaker pint glass. The smell is sweet and fruity, with prominent peach-infused notes of spice-sprinkled sweet green banana. A light graininess laced with fresh-cut grass gains in stature as the drink progresses. The taste is mildly sweet and non-denominationally fruity with a wink of peppery spice and a stiff grassy bitterness that dries the finish. A mellow yeasty nuttiness provides earthy grounding for the profile. The drink is medium in body with crisp carbonation and is quite drinkable.  ",3.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.07

58482,Pencible,2009-07-08,"   This poured a hazy copper color with fluffy light tan head. It smelled like fresh wheat and wild yeast and lemon hops, with candi sugar and salty cloves and earthy caramel. It tasted like sour lemon and wild yeast, with copper and caramel and fresh wheat, along with a bit of coriander and clove. It was fairly thin with moderate carbonation, and had a mild sour aftertaste. Overall this had a nice clean taste that started out a bit overly sour, but became richer and smoother as it warmed. It had a nice balance of spices, and decent body, so it was easy to drink. It seems like not many Belgian ales are offered for under 7% ABV anymore, but this one is a solid option.  ",4,3.5,4,4,4,3.88

Huge coffee flavors, slight chocolate tones, and a nice earthy finish; very nice roasted grains; just slightly unbalanced from the coffee. Went down quite nicely.  ",4.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.91

259020,AdmiralOzone,2018-01-30,"   Pours a murky apricot color with a small off white head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is the highlight of this beer, smells of tangerine, grapefruit and marmalade. The flavor is very sweet and malty with hardly any hop bitterness. No date on this can but presumably fairly fresh. The feel is fine, but overall a beer that I won't purchase (but wouldn't turn down if someone brought me some).  ",3.25,4.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.57
259020,Czequershuus,2017-11-23,"   This beer pours a medium amber with an average head. The aroma features notes of pineapple, mandarin oranges, grapefruit peel, and caramel. The flavor is quite sweet upfront with caramel notes, followed by candied pineapple, overripe mango, peach, and a a burnt sugar finish. The mouthfeel is medium with abundant foam y carbonation. Overall this is a bit of a muddled beer, with too much sweetness and slightly off hop flavors. Decent, but not something I would get again.  ",3.5,3.25,3,3.75,3.25,3.22

311190,woodychandler,2018-04-23,"   I just wrapped up my stated intention for New Beer Sunday (Week 687) & while I was not done for the day, I decided to close out there. The CANQuest (tm) CANtinues with this N2 CAN. From the CAN: ""The Can That You Shake!""; ""Keep Me Ice Cold""; ""Get Whipped[:] 1[)] Gently Shake the Can to Activate Nitrogen. 2[)] Open Then Invert Can Over Your Glass And Pour Hard."" I had kept it cold, but I read in several places that agitation led to gushing so I erred on the side of caution. My Crack! & inverted Glug may have been a bit less aggro than the brewers intended, but it all seemed to work out. I got a decent cascade that formed two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, deep-brown head with excellent retention, still hanging in as I type. Color was dead Black/Opaque (SRM =44), allowing ZERO light penetration. In fact, I thought that it might be sucking the light out of the room. Nose was definitely chocolate, but it was a dark/baker's/semi-sweet chocolate. This was no playing around, especially with its ABV. Mouthfeel was big, thick & full, like a dollop had been scooped onto my tongue. The taste was rich and chocolaty, but really smoky and bitter. Whew! Finish was definitely dry and bitter, but with a lingering chocolate aspect.  ",4,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.09

A: Black body with 2-finger medium beige head with staying power but a little lackluster on the lacing. S: Delicious dark chocolate and medium caramel aromas with a little nutty note in there. I don't get much vanilla per se, but I think the intensity of the other aromas is heightened due to this addition. T: Flavor is a disappointment with a good blast of medium bittersweet chocolate with caramel sweetness but then it just heads to bitterness which seems off to me. The roast quality is too intense as well and does not work well with the above-average bitterness for the style. Alcohol presence is not heavy and there is no yeast character. M: Not as smooth as I was expecting due to the spiky bitterness. Medium body and low carbonation character due to the nitrogen. O: Decent beer but not a good value at all. I am not sure the imperial milk stout style works well but especially when the roast and bitterness is amped up like in this beer.  ",4.25,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.69

Inverted the can while pouring and it formed a beautiful buckwheat pancake batter head. The beer is pitch black in color.Very rich aromas of milk chocolate and roasted malt but then it kind of cuts short. The tasting notes had very rich milk chocolate, almost brownie battered flavored with a rich sweet malt backbone. Just subtle hints of sweet vanilla at the finish. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very dense. Overall I find the aroma and flavors just a little muted, thanks to the nitro. Also more expensive when compared to the Lefthand Milk Stout. Still good beer overall. It really doesn't taste like an 8% beer.  ",4,3.75,4,4,4,3.94

The head died down, but consistently left a short head covering the surface. S: Light aromas of dark malts and a bit of roast are present in the nose. T: The taste has flavors of dark and chocolate malts with a light amount of roast and hints of coffee beans. There is a light amount of bitterness. No alcohol is perceptible. The roasted flavors become stronger in the finish and linger through the aftertaste. M: It feels medium-bodied and silky smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. O: This beer drinks like a Guinness because it hides its alcohol very well. I found the smooth mouthfeel to be the most enjoyable part of this beer.

104824,KFBR392,2014-05-06,"   Batch #209 Appearance: On an aggressive pour, only a light ring of head formed on the edges of the glass. Pours deep dark brown and sits jet black in the glass. Light active carbonation. This beer looks like a huge, menacing barrel aged brew. Smell: The front of the nose is filled with potent bourbon and that familiar lactose sweetness found in many PW stouts. The barrel character carries throughout bringing oak, light smoke, and cherries on the body. The vanilla meshes so well with the bright alcohol sting. Lingering milk chocolate rounds out on the back end. Taste: Lactose sweetness filled with milk chocolate and vanilla hits the palate first. Barrel character warms up on the front of the body and continues to build slowly through, lingering long after drinking. Mossy oak meshes well in the body with the sweetness and chewy malt in this brew brings. Expected more barrel character after the aroma but more of the chocolate, vanilla, and lactose come through. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is an excellent middle ground, providing rich heavy malts but being light enough to allow the decadent flavors to shine through. Carbonation is very light which really gives this brew the feeling of a dessert beer. Overall: Extremely impressed with this. I love that the bourbon characteristics in this brew are so familiar to actually drinking Buffalo Trace. A definite alcohol sting with perfect accents of cherries and oak are all too familiar. I love a big barrel character which this brew brings yet the vanilla and chocolate tones come through very clearly as well. Awesome.  ",4.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.46

Poured from a 22oz Bomber, pours light orange/dark yellow with minimal head. Descent carbonation. Aroma is faint, smells like a mix of Columbus and Nelson Sauvin. Aroma is probably faded due to age of beer. Taste is fine, mild sweetness with a low bitterness level for an IIPA ( I would guess 50 IBUs at this point) Pretty smooth overall, nothing spectacular, however due to its age it taste more like a blonde Barleywine, I would bet good money this IIPA taste vastly different fresh.

Moderately low retention efforts that slip away to just a thin film hugging the edge of the glass. Some light dots and streak of stick remain after each sip. S: Smells real floral with a twist of tangerine and pine. There is a base of caramel malt sweetness emerging to round out the nose. Pleasant hoppy aromas with a nice botanic quality. T: Tastes of floral hops mixed with citrus zest and pine resin. A touch sweeter with some caramel malt presence and bit of toasted pale malts. There is a light tropical flare coming in. Moderate to higher level of bitterness to the beer and a bit of alcohol coming through in flavor. M: Moderate sized body with a nice smooth texture. Carb is a touch on the lower side but does not detract from the overall quality. Nice drying crisp on the finish. Touch of residual linger. D: A fair DIPA with some nice hoppy flavors made up of mostly floral and citrus. A touch on the sweeter side but with honest balance. Slightly unremarkable but nothing really flawed.  ",3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.65
92616,DoubleJ,2013-06-13,"   On-tap at the source itself and served in an 8 ounce snifter. On to the beer: It's amber orange colored and given a tiny head on the pour, leaving a few whisps of lace. This Double IPA goes down the route of a juicy IPA rather than a grapefruit or pine bomb, giving off nice tropical flavors which aren't too intense. Its alcohol is hidden as well, a bonus. However, like the other two Aftershock beers which I samples, has little carbonation. Good as it stands, but with more bubbles has potential to get to the next level.  ",3.5,4,4,3.25,3.75,3.85

195387,Darkmagus82,2015-10-16,"   Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a deep orange amber color with a two finger head of fizzy white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a lighter level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is rather strong of pumpkin pie aroma with a strong roasted pumpkin mixed with cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar. Along with these smells comes some aromas of a biscuit smell and a little bit of earthy smell. Taste – The taste begins with a rather crisp pumpkin flavor that has a decent sum of roast and spice of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice along with a little bit of brown sugar and caramel. As the taste moves forward the roast increases a bit with some other light hop flavors of earth and grass coming to the tongue as well. While up to this point there was almost no cream ale taste to the brew, toward the end, the cream really starts to kick it up; mixing with the roasted pumpkin nicely to create a rather pleasant, not too sweet, roasty but smooth pumpkin pie flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is rather thin with a carbonation level that is a bit on the higher side. I would have liked a little more body and a bit less carbonation on this one, which would have complimented the roasted pumpkin flavors nicely. Overall though, it was a decent feel I suppose. Overall- This was a rather nice drinking, non-very sweet, modest abv. pumpkin ale. The touch of cream ale flavor at the end matches the pumpkin flavors nicely and creates a rather pleasant drinker.  ",,,,,,3.85

125646,digboy,2017-10-30,"   Can dated 9/14/17 - about 6 weeks old, which may influence the review (i.e. hop flavor has faded a bit) Pours a very cloudy, vibrant orange-gold color with a 2 finger fluffy head that leaves nice lacing as it dies down. Aroma has fragrant notes of orange and nectarine and some pine, not too strong but very present. As it warms up a little more alcohol comes through on the nose. The taste follows the smell closely with the hop flavor up front giving way to a light maltiness midway through and finishing off with a nice buzz on the tongue with a bit of tartness and residual sweet hop. The flavor has a little white pepper to it as well. The feel is smooth and soft with a little seltzer. It is a little sticky on the lips as well. Clearly a great NEIPA. The tartness is an interesting take on it and definitely works well. There are many other NEIPAs I would be happier to have before this one but I wouldn't kick it out of bed by any measure.  ",4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.35

92616,UCLABrewN84,2013-05-11,"   On tap at Aftershock Brewing Company in Temecula, CA. Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight tropical aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells much better than it tastes.  ",4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.65
92616,mactrail,2013-04-21,"   This pours a clear dark amber with an auburn cast. Not much of a head in the tall tulip glass, and below average carbonation in general. I am struggling to get much actual smell out of this, but it is powerfully hoppy-fruity in the nose and on the tongue. Rather sweet with a perfumey flavor along with the malt. Intense fruity hop flavor with some candy. Actually, it's really sweet. Dried pineapple and frozen apple juice concentrate. Some roasted malt along with all the caramel. With the right hops this could be an amber Barley Wine. Back of the throat scratchiness. A little woody and rather acidic with all the hops. Plenty of bitterness in the aftertaste. Here's yet another new brewery promising a full line of beers. They list 10 on tap already. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Barons Marketplace on Point Loma Blvd. I wish they would lose the yellow wax dip, but that makes it ""special.""  ",3.25,3,3.5,3,3.25,3.27

Very slightly sweet malty and bready flavor upfront. Leads into a bold amount of herbal hops with medium botterness. Finishes fairly clean with a slight lingering bitterness. Tastes very fresh.

58482,ChainGangGuy,2009-07-03,"   Snatched up a 4-pack of Zotten for $7.49 at Bullock's in Marietta, Georgia. I've typically enjoyed most of the Weyerbacher product I've had, so hopefully this'll hit a home run for me even if I'm not a sick, sick child dying in the hospital. Appearance: Pours out a dark, orange-amber body with a frothy, though somewhat short-lived, bone white head. Smell: Pale malts and light, crisp wheat malt brushed with a light, sweetish caramel sauce. Boldly spicy, zesty scent of fresh-ground pepper along with notes of Dubble Bubble bubblegum and citrus with some pine awakening upon warming. Taste: Pale malts and wheat coming across as a taste of particularly grainy whole wheat (but wholesome) bread. Light touch of sweet caramel glaze. Already there's a zip of peppery spiciness and flavor of bubblegum. Lesser hint of banana. Pinch of Florida orange citrus pith and a few drop of pine resin with a medium-plus amount of hop bitterness. A bit of watercress late in the taste. Dry, earthy, spicy finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Drinkability: Why, that's generally likable! Plenty of flavors and complexity to keep me fairly well-entertained, but, thankfully, it's easy-going on the overall ABV. I do look forward the three remaining bottles!  ",4,4,4,4,4,4
58482,mikey711,2009-06-30,"   Poured into an oversized wine glass. A bit darker than I expected as it was amber in tint with a thick head that disappeared quickly. It smells very earthy, but still has that bubblegummy sweetness in the nose as well. Also a touch of hop spice. I think i was hoping for a bit more sourness, but this was a good effort. It is earthy and and full of esters. The mouth feel is pretty consistant with th style but it isn't going to replace any imports in this style. Also, there is a bit of a soapiness which was a bit off putting.  ",3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.64
58482,jwc215,2009-06-29,"   Poured into tulip glass: Pours golden amber with a thin white head that slowly becomes a patch. Some lacing sticks. Nice color, but doesn't have the head retention or lacing that I would expect. THe smell is of a sweet fruitiness and grainy with some yeasty notes. Slight tart notes are mixed in from the fruitiness. The taste is sweet and fruity - hint of bubblegum - that quickly turns to a dry, herbal finish. It it light-bodied. A few more effervescent bubbles would make it more lively, IMO. This is sweet and fruity/grainy turning (almost too quickly) to herbal (aspirin-y) dry. It has a certain character that gives it the ""American attempt at Belgian"". It's fine, for that.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
58482,GeoffFromSJ,2009-06-29,"   This beer caught me off-guard in how good it was. A pleasant mix of Brett funk and hops. Brett on the nose. The taste is well constructed. Brett up-front.

58482,WVbeergeek,2009-06-27,"   Appears a beautifully clouded copper orange hue with a thick chunky doughnut like cream tinted white head, has some yeast specks floating on board. Lacing is perfect fine Belgian style lacing evenly strong around my glass. Aromatics offer up floral hops with citrus components joining in, mildly spiced yeast notes with fresh baked bread in the biscuit malt department. Very soothing and delicious smelling brew from Weyerbacher. A superb blend of flavors collide with cookie dough like malt and sweet bread layers with yeast spicing the party up a bit. Finishing with mildly earthy, pungently citric, and pleasantly floral hop additions. A bit of undeniable Belgian funk going down brings it all together. A perfect blend of spiced bready hoppy ale sits in my glass very well done the most finesse to come of Dan Weirback in some time. Mouthfeel is so smooth carbonation bubbles to tickle a bit but overall the balance of malt and hops streaks so nicely across the palate, quite the interesting medium bodied Belgian style pale. Leaves traces of yeast spice and bittering hops on the palate, and hop burps will follow and tickle the nose. Drinkability overall kicks ass one of those OMFG beers that inspires me to try as many beers as I can. A case of this is in my near future I have to sit on these and watch them evolve, the best American brewed belgian style pale to cross my palate reminiscent but by no means a copycat of Orval Trappist.  ",5,5,5,5,5,5
58482,OldSchoolGamer,2009-06-25,"   I haven't had a lot of Belgain Pale Ales. I think the last one I had was Leffe Blonde, which I hated. Lets see if Weyerbacher can cange my perception of the style: A: Pours a nice golden straw color. Head is a bright white color, but dissipates rather quickly. Lacing is very minimal. S: Lots of Belgian yeast. Some fruityness. I also get a touch of hops. T: Pretty solid Belgian Pale Ale. First thing you get is the Belgian yeast. There is also some spice in there. Then there is a almost melon-like fruityness. The finish is grassy hops. Not bad. M: Medium to light bodied. Pretty carbonated mouthfeel. Very smooth. D: Decent flavors and mouthfeel. However, I think this is a one and done type of beer. Drinks easily, but not something I could drink a lot of. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. The Belgian character is there, but there is also a unique fruit and hop character that adds to the complexity and enjoyment of the beer. Definetly worth a shot, even if you are not a Belgian Ale fan. Recommended.  ",3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.75
58482,magnj,2009-06-24,"   a - Somewhat hazy orange body sits below a generous film that developed after an initial 2 finger fluffly white head. s - Spicy Belgian yeast, way more up front than I was expecting, then again I don't know what exactly I was expecting. Inviting and sweet, missing the hops I was expecting but I assume that will come in the taste. t - Delicate hops flavor overshadowed by spicy Belgian yeasties. I was expecting a hop bomb from Weyerbacher but this is not it. That being said, this is a tasty brew. Sweet but not overdone, finishes clean and dry but the complex yeast flavors linger for a while. m/d - Nice and light though still a bit sweet like it's big Belgian Triple brothers. Much more refreshing but I'm still wary, I'm used to this taste having a sneaky alcohol punch to it in the end. Really drinkable, complex and a fun style I have not had much experience with.  ",4,4,4,4,4.5,4.1
58482,NiceGuyMike,2009-06-20,"   Dark clear golden hue with a lovely white, fluffy head with almost no lacing. This brew does not have strong smells, but there are some light fruity Belgian fruity sents with rather strong smell of of alcohol. First taste is a generic American Belgian flavor with spicy pepper and bitterness (a bit much too) to follow. A wonderful Bready flavor follows the spice. Oddly the alcohol flavors are well controled. Medium body with some nice effervecance which highlights the pepperiness. I like the breadyness of this beer.  ",3.5,3,4,3.5,4,3.68

58482,BirdFlu,2009-06-19,"   Pours a copper-amber color with foamy off-white head. I was expecting it to be cloudier for some reason, nice head, though. Aroma is bready, citrusy with lemon zest and orange peel, a bit yeasty and certainly tons of banana and clove. So kind of typical. for your spiceir belgian pales.. Taste is pretty much same as aromas, yeasty, spicery with black pepper, etc. I would like it a bit sweeter. Mouth is moderate, fairly spicey with a peppery aftertaste/feel in the back of the throat. Overall its lighter in body and sessionable in that sense. The flavor is a bit off, though, and the spice is a bit much. I would enjoy it more with a bit more sweetness.  ",4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.45
58482,BigMike,2009-06-19,   Pours a cloudy yellow with pale white fizzy head. Smell is very yeasty and grainy. Some citrus and hops and a touch of floral. Taste is the same. Lot's and lot's of yeasty sweetness. A touch of grapefruit and a slight hoppy finish. Thin mouthfeel. Not overly carbonated. Easy to drink. The thing that gets me about this ine is that it's a session beer that comes in a 4-pack. Good summer brew though. Probably not one i will try again. Not that theres anything wrong with it. This just isn't my favorite style.  ,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.65

T: The taste is similar to the smell and has flavors of light malts along with slight hints of sweetness. M: It feels just about medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.

58482,ColForbinBC,2009-06-12,"   12oz bottle poured in a tulip A rather deep orange body with a good amount of clarity and visible carbonation. A thick, slightly off-white cap rises and falls quickly. A small amount of sticky lace is left on the glass. A hearty Belgian yeast aroma, ripe fruits, with an herbal, medicinal hop profile and a solid bready malt. Raisins and bananas are the primary fruit. An astringent, medicinal hop profile really cuts through all of the other flavors and took me a sip or two to adjust. A signature Belgian yeast flavor of banana and an adequate amount of spice blend in with the aforementioned astringent hops and orange rind. The finish is a strong, bready malt flavor, think raisin bread. A very creamy mouthfeel. Medium bodied with near perfect carbonation. They nearly nailed this one. Finish is dry and bready with just a touch of bitterness. A pretty sessionable offering, easily drinkable. Would like to see it in six packs rather than four packs. A solid addition to the weyerbacher lineup. I will definitely be buying this again.  ",4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.03

58482,vikingloki,2009-06-11,"   On tap at the Bear Creek Grille in Macungie. I'm a Weyerbacher fan, I admire and them and usually love their big beers. Comes to the table in a frosty pint glass, almost a reddish color with not much of a head, probably lost in the trip to the table. i like the color, it's a ""light foxy red"". Smells good, interesting, yeasty, bready, hoppy, complex. Taste is not what I expect - there is a very unusual, but I wouldn't say bad, kind of 'zing' thru-out, my guess is it's the yeast. Beer finishes dry with a little hop smack at the end like an afterthought. The yeasty taste lingers on the palate and to my dismay does not compliment the beer cheese dip and beer bread. I'm kinda on the fence about this one, I'd like to give it another chance sometime. Maybe having one that's been bottled in a month might mellow out that oddish tase.  ",4,3.5,3,4,3,3.28
58482,Hojaminbag,2009-06-10,"   A hazy, pale, golden body with about one and a half fingers of off white head that sticks around for awhile, but doesn't really leave any lacing behind. The nose is fruity and a little spicy. There is a nice fruit flavor in there that I cannot really pinpoint as a single fruit: just take my word for it that it is fruit. Next there is a slight peppert flavor, and maybe a touch of ansie-like flavor. There is just a touch of bready flavors from the malt. Mostly a yeast driven beer, and pretty good. Mouthfeel is appropriately thick and full. Pretty drinkable beer. I think I saw some cases for less than 40 bucks; I might go pick one up.  ",3.5,4,4,4,4,3.97
58482,tempest,2009-06-10,"   On-tap for $5 a pint at Liberty St. Tavern in Allentown. Appeared a hazy amber with a short head. This is an interesting beer, but I get some awful off aromas that really kill it for me. Still there's a relatively big, hoppy flavor with citrus and mild pine, while the aroma hits me with dirt and cleaning solvent - not cool. This beer needs some work, but it's not a good beer yet.  ",4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.19
58482,woodychandler,2009-06-10,"   An aggressive pour resulted in two fingers of rose-shaded head with good retention. Nose had a slightly perfumey accent, kind of reminiscent of Juicyfruit gum, definitely yeast-driven in its origin. The color was a hugely hazy deep-amber. The mouthfeel was full, thick, and bubbly with a very sweet bubble gum (think generic pink or Juicyfruit) flavor on the tongue. The finish lingered with that same bubble gum flavor. At 6% ABV and with its realtive lack of banana esters, I really see this as an alternative to Hefeweizen, which I dislike.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4
58482,Birdiebeagle,2009-06-09,   Bottle Pours a clear goldenrod with a good off white head. The head is frothy and diminishing. Produces good lacing. Aroma is good like juicey fruit gum. Good sweet malts with a touch of hops. The taste is good. Good carbonation and a nice mouthfeel. Has a good balance of sweet and hop. Not to sweet but sweeter than hoppy. Has light to medium body.

Lately the beers I have tried, given to me by friends, have seemed much higher quality. I am happy to report that this may be the best beer they have made to date. It is hard to tell that this is not made in Belgium. I guess hard work and changes have paid off for this Brewery. As far as this beer they have nailed every aspect of the style. Congrats to Dan.

58482,JoePetto,2009-06-07,"   On draft at TND in Wayne in 13oz wide beer flute. This is not an attempt to create a rendition of a true belgian pale ale, rather it is a ""tweener"" beer bridging the belgian and american pale ale styles. That said, this is a really enjoyable beer regardless of style. Funkiness of the Merry Monks yeast strain hits first then followed by a nice amount of hops flavor on the finish. The beer is zippy with flavor and carbonation and extremely refreshing. At 6% ABV, this beer is made to session.  ",4.5,4.5,5,5,5,4.85

Taste: 'Light hops and dirty earth' were the first things that came to mind when drinking this; it reminded me of Old Style. Mouthfeel: Considerably light carbonation - rather flat, actually. Overall: Certainly not one of the best beers I have had, let alone one of the best blondes I have had. I had this along with Brouwerij West's 'Tripel' and was excited as it was my first time trying their beers. I don't think I will be revisiting this one.  ",4,3.75,3.5,3,3.75,3.59

64319,beertunes,2013-07-17,"   16.9oz bottle poured into straight pint glass. Poured a hazy yellow color with over 3/4 inch of white head that decent retention and moderate lacing. The aroma featured a good grain base, had a bright yeast scent, and had a bit of spiciness floating around. The flavors followed the scents pretty closely, grain, spice, and yeast, it was a pretty typical flavor profile for the style. The body was smooth and even, with a clean finish. Drinkability was good, the beer went down smoothly and quickly. Overall, a nice little beer, but nothing special. Worth grabbing if you see a nice price on it.  ",3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.34
64319,mhaugo,2013-07-04,"   500ml bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Appearance: Light butterscotch, thin white head, as cloudy as grandma’s cataract. Smell: I swear to god this smells like a skunked Corona. It’s that bottle that’s been sitting on the shelf at 7-11 for who knows how long and could not have possibly absorbed more light. Mutated, spicy noble hops. Terrible. Taste: Also tastes like bad Corona. Bad Corona that someone ran through a grain bed of pilsner malt and wheat. I almost could not finish it. Mouthfeel: Light body, medium carbonation. Overall: This brewery could not possibly ask more of me as a consumer. I heard about what they’re doing, went out and purchased a bottle of each, and will probably never buy anything else they make. I’ve been underwhelmed five times in a row. This beer may be the worst of them. I absolutely love the artwork on their labels, and the fact that they intend to rotate them, but I guess I’ll be appreciating them on the shelf going forward.  ",3.5,1.5,1.5,3,2.5,1.97

64319,mactrail,2013-04-26,"   A light and spritzy brew with a distinct Belgian edge. Pale hazy golden in the glass with a modest foam and adequate spritzy mouthfeel. This tastes a lot like the Swing Session Saison from Victory that I tried last night, though a little more robust. Still this is pale and light bodied with yeasty funk and more of a Brettanomyces flavor. A pleasant beery smell. Very bitter with the yeasty flavors, lasting long into the aftertaste. Quite drinkable and not overpriced. But very dry and hard edged. No trace of fruit or mellow malt in this one. Eventually this just pushes to the bitter end and I can't finish a bottle of this stuff, in spite of its virtues. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego for $5.15.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.75,3.35

It's been aging for at least 8 or 9 months, I think, so it seems somewhat mellow. Tones of lemon, though not obnoxiously so. Mild yeast and bread are also there. A nice easy drinker. Not too bad, and better than I seem to recall from the last time I tried this beer.  ",3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.69

Reviewed live. Cost was $5.99. Expectations are above average; I dig the marketing. Served straight from the refrigerator. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. A: Pours a three finger beige colour head of nice cream and thickness, and good retention - thought the ABV is merely 5.50%. Body colour is a pale yellow. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Transparent. Nonopaque. Sm: Fresh clean pale malts. Lemongrass. Lemon zest. Citrus zest. A clean appealing aroma for the style. Little yeast. No alcohol is detectable. An average strength aroma. A bit adulterated. Artificial floral notes. Artificial lime. A bit reminiscent of a crappy Spanish lager. T/Mf: Artificial crappy lime up front immediately. A clean malt and decent zesty lemon body. Comes off artificial and a bit syrupy. No yeast or alcohol comes through. Very strange for the style. A bit garbage. I don't care much for it. It's certainly not well balanced. Overly malty. Poorly built for the style. Dr: Drinkable but underwhelming and overpriced. Very forgettable. Beneath pedestrian. Why brew this? I don't look forward to trying this brewery's other beers. D  ",3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,2.26

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and some slight skunk which is weird because the bottle is brown. The smell reminds me more of a foreign lager than a Belgian style pale ale. Fortunately, the taste is much better with malt, grain, yeast, and some spice flavors on the finish. I am also picking up some grassy and herbal flavors as the beer warms up a bit. There is a medium spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that walks an interesting balance of having a mediocre smell but a great taste.  ",4,3,4.5,3.5,4,3.91
64319,Wowcoolman,2012-06-02,"   Sampled on tap at Whole Foods with Brian Mercer, the creative force behind Brouwerij West. Pours a yellow-gold color with some head retention. The nose is a tad funky with some lemony esters joining in. The taste is refreshing with a dry, straw-like character and a slight phenolic finish. Brain is devoted to recreating Belgian flavors and I would not think this was a West Coast beer. The mouthfeel is ample and creamy. Quite enjoyable if you enjoy old world styles.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

64319,jminsc76,2011-05-03,"   On tap presently at The Library in Santa Monica. Pours a white frothy head atop a yellow, golden body. A highly effervescent look with pretty bubbles rising and dancing upon agitation. The bouquet is highly floral, with strong wheat aromas and mild lavender. More or less it's like smelling a White Orchard from The Bruery, though slightly less floral, with more wheat and yeast. Flavors are yeasty, much like the aromas, much like White Orchard, though smoother and with substantial meat behind it. It’s almost as if I am chewing on the wheat, with a highly complex, smooth, dry heartiness that makes it so pleasant. Which leads me to the… …mouthfeel, which is dry and ebullient upon swishing, and very clean. Overall, this is damn good, maintaining high drinkability both from its flavors, mouthfeel, and excellent crispness. Ideal for pairing with food (thinking a good salad with some goat cheese or a fish dish) as well as a standalone sipping aperitif. Easily could I throw back two or three per sitting.  ",4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.3
64319,DoubleJ,2011-04-25,"   On-tap at Beachwood BBQ, on to the beer: Pale yellow in color with little head retention on top. The aroma is difficult to make out; it smells most like a barnyard. A little sulfur make way. I thought the funk would lighten up from there, but it keeps going strong into the taste. From the taste, I could close my eyes and pretend I was on a farm. In fact, it seems to resemble a saison better than a Belgian Blond. At some points it's pushing itself to being uncomfortable, though I find a way enjoy it. This is definately not for the faint of heart.  ",3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.37
64319,beagle75,2011-04-23,"   Draft service into a long-stemmed fluted tulip glass at Beachwood BBQ. A: Slightly hazy, medium golden color with one finger of fine white foam head. No lacing remains on the glass, although a few submerged and clustered bubbles cling to the side. S: Toasted grain and clean but characterful Belgian yeast present a smell that is slightly spicy and herbaceous, but otherwise clean. T: Begins almost dry, with bright fruit consisting of pear and golden raisin alongside estery farmhouse yeast. Acidity is managed well, remaining restrained but lively. Delicate pale malt emerges in the middle as flavors of malt and yeast turn bready. The finish is mild and yeasty, seeing a tasteful and palate-cleansing resurgence of acidity. M: Thin to medium viscosity, refreshing on the palate, early acidity is not quite felt, with moderate carbonation. D/O: This is an unassuming beer of ordinary strength and intensity that delivers Belgian-style character in exactly the expected quantity. Comparable to Russian River Redemption, it lacks the extreme dryness and blanketing wheat-like quality of that other beer. It is a bit limp to look at, in a way that Russian River beers almost never are, but otherwise it makes for a worthy saison/single cross-over.  ",3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.77

Aroma is sweet and boozy, later becoming a little more earthy and woody at room temperature. Initially it's like sniffing a pour of Buffalo Trace. Taste has more nuance, though still plenty of whiskey heat packed in. Woody drying aftertaste, much like a sip of bourbon. Middle has notes of earthy roasted malt, toffee, caramel, toasted almond, dry tobacco leaves. Chewy and rich, but not without some sting and numbing alcohol.

Next comes some fudgy brownie notes that pair nicely with he barrel notes. The taste is much like the nose with heavy vanilla notes paired with fudge and cocoa. The barrel aging has really smoothed the base out and has intensified the chocolate notes. My only slight issue with the beer is the body doesn't hold up to the big flavors. The flavors are there no doubt, but it is just a little on the thin side. Overall, I like where things are going for pipeworks, will be excited to see what other barrel aged brews are on the horizon.  ",3.75,4.5,4.25,3.5,4,4.16

A little closed straight from the cellar, but after an hour, this opens up very nicely. The vanilla, choclate and alcohol notes are well balanced at this point.

Couldn't find any info on the thirsty dog website about the beer, but it isn't their advertised as their normal berliner. The bar is a legit craft haven in the area so I trust it wasn't a mistake. It had a dry hay and orange peel nose, the tart is gentle but noticeable with the citrus carrying through. The big thing is that it is very creamy and velvety feel, with a vanilla orangcicle flavor, which I assume comes from the barrel aging. Have not had the regular Berliner from them so nothing to compare it to, but this version was excellent  ",,,,,,4.54

Slick and oily. Very light malts. Finishes on the bitter grapefruit, pine side of the spectrum. Still fairly mundane. M/O: A medium body. It is almost impressive that this is not watery and thin.

Has a nice spiced fruit aroma to it, with the camomille sticking out, but also some coriander and decent floral notes. Has a solid citrusy taste about it, with the hop taste being fairly understated, mixing well with the spices. Has a nice full body and a solid bitterness.

47792,IBUnit63,2009-02-07,"   Into a pint glass we go. This pours much like a Belgian pale...1 1/2-finger head with solid lacing. Body is very light lemon-honey and with a little bit of cloud cover. Of course this is extremely floral, fruity and calming. The chamomile is definitely the master of this domain. There's a fair amount of tropical (and other) fruits here - cantaloupe, a bit of pear, too...and a little papaya? The hop bitterness can best be described as Saaz-ish...tight and a little piney. The chamomile has that nighttime herbal tea quality to it - it's pretty hardcore in a cask. I wonder if the chamomile lends itself better to a regular cold tap - it gets a little thick after a while. Palate feel is very sweet and tight, with a heavy wallop of bitterness from the chamomile husks. Pretty hefty. Yup - this is OK but I think in a regular tap it would do better - chamomile on cask is a little over the top. Interesting pour though.  ",,,,,,3.65

M - Feel goes down smooth and clean, with some herbal grapefruit hop bitterness clinging to the palate. Medium full body with good carbonation. Overall, another nice beer from Spiteful Brewing. These guys haven't let me down yet, and by the looks of things, it seems like I'm going to have to try some more of their beers.

Really low overall residual bitterness. The more I drink it, the more the bitter hangs around a little. It's not overpowering at all though. Light alcohol burn at the end... not necessarily bad though. M: Medium. Maybe a little on the light side. Nothing to write home about. O: Solid beer that I'd have another one of.

84394,drabmuh,2012-09-14,"   Served on draft at CK, served in a snifter, reviewed from notes. This beer is odd to put it politely, to be less polite, it spent enough time in the barrel to remove any interesting hop character but not long enough to pick up a lot of barrel character, the resulting beer is a dull bland shadow of an IPA that I completely don't understand as a beer. Beer is orangish with a mild haze and some wispy head, mostly clear, looks like beer. Aroma is mildly oaky, some whiskey / booze. Beer is light in body and finishes a little dry with minimal bitterness and some liquor / alcohol / oakiness up front. There is no tannic character to the beer and the overall is just a disappointment. Maybe I just don't like barrel aged IPAs but I have yet to have one that I thought, ""Yeah, this did improve the beer."" IPAs are one of those beers that is close to impossible to improve through the exposure to time, oxygen, and wood. Not saying it cannot be done but this is yet another example in a growing postulate of mine that this is not likely to yield good results. Not a repeat for me.  ",4,3.5,3,3,3,3.18

Never had a sessioned IPA barrel aged. Unique making it a must try. I am guessing te ABV listed for this one was off a bit but it was advertised at 4.5.  ",4,4,4,4.5,4,4.05

A: Pours a very cloudy, bright, light orange color with a one inch head, good retention, and robust lacing. S: The fragrance reaches out to the nose from a distance while decanting. Aromas of mango, orange, pineapple, and peach predominate. Pepper/pine/spice notes. T: Largely follows the nose with flavors of peach and orange dominant. Bitterness kicks in slowly, leading to a refreshing finish. M: Medium bodied with solid carbonation. Creamy and smooth. O: This is really a great New England style DIPA, honestly the best that I have had. Certainly worth a trip to the brewery.  ",4.75,5,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.79

125646,HankSingle,2017-10-26,"   Goodness, me. A gift from a friend, just back from Western MA. I thought it looked a little light - a beautiful, bright, luminous light orange, hazy as the name suggests, but it seemed pale for the stats. Everything else, though. Ripping fruits on the nose, this drinks like the most perfectly balanced mimosa - fresh squeezed orange juice and kinetic effervescence...it's impossible to connect this beer with its alcohol content until after you've finished it, it is just so light, and so lovely. Soft and creamy on the tongue, it leaves the exactly perfect trail of crisp bitterness on the release. I loved this beer, very close to the best one I've ever had, I think. I was shattered when it was gone.  ",4.75,5,5,5,5,4.99

125646,Holderness,2017-10-26,"   Canned 12 days ago. L — See: Name S — Orange, cream, chalky yeastiness, mango, guava, and, interestingly, a touch of spirulina/chlorella T — Peach and orange dominate the palate. Reminds me more of Julius than Green, but has less of that orange creamsicle quality. Also getting pineapple, papaya, mango, and white bready malts F — Smooth, gently creamy, fluffy texture. Medium- mouthfeel, medium carb. Immensely smooth and drinkable for the ABV. Practically no bitterness, save for a slight tea-like quality between sip and finish. Semi-sweet O — Even though it doesn’t quite top the perfection that is Julius/Green, this is still my favorite DIPA to date. I simply cannot believe that this is 8.2% ABV. Drinking blind, I would guess 5.5% 94/100 EDIT(9/13/18): 2-week-old can. Reaffirming all above notes. It is so hard to not chug this. Straight peach juice  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.68

63496,Onenote81,2010-11-13,"   Stopped in here with the family for lunch before we headed to Pilot Mt State Park. I've been here in the past and they haven't had any beer at the time. Used to just have 2 offerings. They now have 4, all of which were on tap. I ordered this one as I am a sucker for IPAs. The bartendress wasn't sure if this was an American or English style. I labelled it American from the hop profile. Came out a very dark rusty copper color with a thin white head on it. Little retention, but there were many pretty sip rings left after each sip. The nose was pretty basic with some floral tones and a sharp hoppy scent. Decent body on this one. Moderate carbonation. Good depth. Wonderful bitter hops all over this one. Some faint orange sweetness, grass, and more hops. This one is a hop-head beer for sure. Wasn't sure what to expect from this little place, but if this is any indication of what the rest of their lineup is like, I'll be back to try the rest. Good beer.  ",,,,,,3.73
58482,Gavage,2009-06-05,"   Appearance: orange in color with some yellow highlights. A one finger head lingers around a while. Smell: bread and a spicy yeast aroma is very pleasant on the nose. Taste: bready caramel base with a very spicy yeast flavor that comes through quite strongly. Bitterness is a bit mild, and there is a soft fruit sweetness in the background. Mouthfeel: lightly crisp throughout. Medium bodied. Aftertaste is long as the yeast spiciness lingers in the mouth. Drinkability: this beer went down quite easily and after the second glass, I could have had another. Nice new addition to the regular lineup.  ",4.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.15
58482,ATPete,2009-06-02,"   12oz bottle Pours a hazy yellow color with a medium sized white head. Lots of banana in the aroma right from the get go, bready yeast, clovey wheat beer like spice and a mild dosage of hops. Good flavor, definitely Belgian inspired, i like the serious malt structure here, bready again with just enough sweetness to match. IMO this beer needs more hops, i know they are going for a balanced Belgian/American Pale Ale here but a little added bitterness and crispness from another peppering of hops wouldnt hurt this beer any. None the less another solid offering from Weyerbacher and one im glad to have year round. The artwork and package design is great as well, i think this is the visual direction Weyerbacher needs to take in order to put their beer in more peoples hands.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.6
58482,yen157,2009-05-27,"   Honey orange with yellow flashes. Not much head, though a creamy collar remains. Bright, lively nose with big banana, clove phenol, and breadiness reminiscent of raw pizza dough. Flavors follow in lockstep with the nose except that it is punctuated by a pleasant tart yeast character and balanced by mineral water and New World hoppiness, all in bittering and flavor as well as some bubblegum late into the finish. I made the mistake drinking this out of the fridge too cold. Breadiness came out as it warmed. Overall, very good. It does a great job filling the niche of something interesting and sessionable that's not a lager or basic pale.  ",3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,3.95
58482,tpd975,2009-03-27,"   A: Pours a slightly cloudy deep piss yellow hue. The head was huge at least 4 fingers in height. The retention was just as ridiculous. Tons of extra thick foam clings to the glass to form 3D lacing. S: Nice light belgian aromas. Light banana with subtle hints of spice. Yeast dominates, but there are nice bready notes as well. T: Very similar to aroma but a bit more bold. Nice Banana like Belgian yeast. Bread, with notes of pepper and clove. M: Medium in body, pretty smooth with great carbonation....almost too much. D: Not bad, the folks in Belgium won't be doing back flips over this one, but it is pretty tasty nonetheless.  ",4,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.68
58482,mikereaser,2009-02-06,"   A - pours a murky orange color with 1/4 inch of foam S - not a whole of aroma, some bananas, floral hops T - again, bananas, bready flavor, with a little bit of floral hop M/D - really dry finish, but nice carbonation. A bit tart to me, not my favorite.  ",3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.35
58482,akorsak,2008-11-23,"   A 12 oz bottle from the Riserva release last summer. A: The ale is a brilliant, bright golden color, crystal clear save for the stream of bubbles in the center of the glass. A half a finger of head almost spilled out over the glass. S: The aroma is strong, even from an arm's length the Belgian scents are strong. Candi sugars, pepper and dry fruity yeast are all strong. T: Wow! This ale is intensely dry. The yeast strain has done its job and stripped all of the sugars out of this beer. Pepper is strong, tempering the ale with a pleasant heat. The remnants of candi sugar swirl around near the end of each sip. Pale grains add a caramel flavor and a nice dose of citrusy hops is not too strong. The ale is very similar to Orval, save for the lack of brett. M: The mouthfeel is very crisp, clean and sharp with a constant stream of carbonation to keep things jumping. D: A nice one-off offering that, at least for me, got lost behind Thirteen and Riserva.  ",4,4,4,4.5,4,4.05
58482,SaCkErZ9,2008-11-16,"   Thanks to Risser09 for this one. Pours from a 12oz bottle into a pilsner glass. SLightly cloudy golden orange color with a stiff and tall white head. Rocky, dense, and massive. Tons of lacing and the head lasts for the duration of consumption. Aroma is slightly subdued. Certainly some belgian sugars, a touch of yeast. Slight earthy hop aroma. Perhaps some spicy corriander or black pepper. Sweet upfront with a sweet hop bite in the back. Belgian sugars. Ends with a different, sweet fruitiness typical in a Tripel. Distinct hop bite in the finish. Finishes really dry and crisp. Somewhat oily as well. I actually enjoyed this one. Seems like it may be an American interpretation as the hops seem to be non tradtional and more citrusy (read: west coast USA). I really liked this, alot. Thanks again to Risser09 for this one.  ",4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.01
58482,orbitalr0x,2008-10-06,"   12oz bottle. Excited to give this a try. Pours into my glass a hazy yellow orange with a billowing bubbly white head on top. Lots of active carbonation. Aromas start out with sweet pale grain malts along with some banana and spice with a bold clove accent. Belgian yeast as well. Rather mellow. First sip brings a crisp light grain malt upfront that carries with it some sweetness. Some banana and fruit accents follow along with a spiciness of clove and light pepper. Finishes with a touch of Belgian yeast and lingering sweetness. Overall it is just not cohesive and ends up being rather bland. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with an onslaught of fast moving carbonation. The excess carbonation gets in the way and knocks down my enjoyment of the brew. Overall, I'm really not digging this brew. It falls somewhat flat flavor wise and ends up being rather boring. Thanks to afterexile for the opportunity to try it.  ",4,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.91
58482,PittBeerGirl,2008-08-11,   A- This is a beautiful Belgian Pale. Body is a cloudy pale yellow that is served with a 1-2 finger white foamy head. The head eventually settles down to &lt;1/2 finger and retains this well. Cloudiness is thick and uniform. S- Lots of banana and floral hops come to the nose. Thats about all I was able to gather. T- This is pretty heavy on banana (for the style) upfront. A very perfume-like funky flavor is also present that I can't put my finger on. This all has a moderate yeast backbone and spices added. A little bit of floral hop bitterness comes through for the finish and not much lingers on. M- Weyerbacher did a great job with the mouthfeel. Low-Medium carbonation with a smooth yeasty body. D- This is a decent Pale Ale that is pretty easy to drink. Its strength is definitely the mouthfeel. Definitely not my favorite of the style but a decent example.  ,4.5,3.5,3,4.5,3.5,3.46

58482,Gueuzedude,2008-08-09,"   Quite aromatic smelling as I pour this beer; I get layers of fruit and vibrant spice. A soft pour yields a four-finger thick, light tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass. The beer is a bright, amber color that shows an almost brilliantly clear, copper color when held up to the light. Aromas of ripe pears, sweet plums and aromatic apples mix with spice notes of big clove and light pepper. Towards the finish some notes of thin, fermented grape juice aromas start to come through; a touch tart, almost cider like and with a mineral, almost metallic edge. A touch of dusty malt towards the finish helps to round things out a bit. An interesting aroma that accentuates fruit and lots of clove. Lightly sweet with a mix of apple and some huge, phenolic driven clove flavors up front. The beer is quite well carbonated, which contributes to a definite fizzy texture as it flows across the tongue. The finish has quite a bit of sharp phenolic notes to it, leaning towards clove but with a touch of a harsher edge and something a bit like cola. Underneath the omnipresent phenolics is a touch of fresh grain character, some soft fruity esters (that the clove notes seem to make cidery at times) and some spicy higher alcohols. Pretty light bodied, though not thin, the carbonation definitely helps with the perceived lightness as well. Definitely characterful for a Belgian Pale Ale. It can be a bit too phenolic at times as the Clove character is a bit dominating. Not bad though.  ",4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.7
58482,OWSLEY069,2008-08-08,"   Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color, with a off white head. In the aroma, candy sugar, and green apple. In the taste, sugary, green apples, and green grapes. A smooth and medium mouthfeel, with a dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Good, but a bit sweeter than expected, and a nice small tart fruit note.  ",4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.55
58482,marcpal,2008-06-25,"   12oz bottle with an ugly, oldschool label that shows this is a one-off brew. Loved this beer at the event a few weeks back and was unhappy only to grab the last few bottles left for sale and would've loved more. Just hope this one starts getting mass produced. The first low abv WB brew that has really blown me away. A: Clear gold, looks like a Belgian- almost the appearance of Duvel hue without the monster head. Still ample foam and spidery lacing that doesnt go anywhere fast. N: Spices, coriander, orange rind, lemon rind. Grassy, hoppy notes a bit biting. Clearly has doughy flavors coming my way and banana yeasts. T: Complexity for the low alcohol- sweetness, fruitiness, hops and spices all take their turns. Stronger flavor profile warmed down a bit. Little bit of dishwasher detergent, but oddly not in a bad way. M: Spices dominate like a good Belgian. Full, doughy and chewy. D: At 6.2%, could drink this all day in any season. Refreshing and tasty- would love to see this one replace House, Muse, Scotch or one of their other more ""session"" oriented beers. Many dont rave about this one, but I do. Completely delicious.  ",4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.28

M-Medium-light body with a fair amount of creaminess. Little carbination, to be expected from a firkin poured brew. Felt somewhat thin. D-Interesting for sure...but something is simply not quite right. A good attempt that may need to be revised.  ",3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.7
58482,rodcom,2008-05-18,"   Had a growler of the Alpha beer the second night after they cracked open the firkin at the Drafting room in Exton PA. Overall very glad I tried the beer. It is a very unusual taste, color and feel for a beer. First the color/look - pale yellow color, but the yeast leaves it cloudy and there looked to be chunks as you poured it in the glass. Taste wise it was kind of a blend between a Belgian Pale and a wheat beer. Feel - it was a beer you felt like you were chewing it. Usually, I like the warm of a cask style beer, but in this case think it tasted better after I put the growler in the fridge for the second night. My recommendation - definitely try a glass of this beer when you get a chance since it is so different though not positive you will like it enough to try a second, but you will be able to say you had a ""firkin"".  ",4.5,4,3,4,2,3.23

58482,Med,2008-05-16,"   Firkin at The Drafting Room in Spring House. A - Opaque but not too light. A tan color with very little head or lacing. S - Here is where the Belgian yeast starts to show itself. Bubble gum and some citrus with a definite hop presence. T - To me this beer doesn't quite know it's place in the world. It's got some of the ""wheatiness"" of a wit as well as some of the ""bubble gum"" noted in the smell, but an American hop profile. Pleasant, but not something I'd go out of my way for. M - Medium bodied with low carbonation. The fact that this comes from a firkin has a lot to do with this. D - Pleasant. Not bad at all, not great, but pleasant. Certainly an interesting interpretation of a style underrepresented in this area.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.35

Taste follows the nose with notes of orange, tangerine, grapefruit, orange blossom honey providing a touch of sweetness. Bit of a rindy bitterness that is cut with the sweetness.

104824,Karl_M,2014-04-24,"   Can I say, ""Fuck you, Goose Island""? Just curious. If you don't get your tounge wet with this brew, then you have not had the best bourbon barrel aged stout ever. Vanilla bitterness and cacao darkness blanket this milk stout with the rounding out needed when in the presence of the blessed bourbon sweetness that comes from a freshly emptied cask. The lack of fizz upon pouring and subsequent headless beer in my mug of 5000-mile-old motor oil had me wondering if I'd recieced a dud and dude, it was not a dud. Let me tell you... The carbonation was felt on my tounge from the first heavenly sip through the last savory drop. The words I have cannot describe the decadent internal bliss that is swelling inside me.

104824,timc100,2014-04-23,"   Batch 209 - Big, bold, imperial stout - very dark, mocha head, thin barrel-charred lacing. Incredibly pronounced note of raw bourbon - caramel and booze. Other barrel notes of char, oak, vanilla as well as incredibly dark, bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee. The finish is spectacular - very strong, as if it actually gets bigger. Fresh from the oak - this is very barrel forward with tons of whiskey, and in every way fantastic.  ",4.5,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.47

104824,blankenhoney,2014-04-06,"   12oz bottle from PW batch #75. Pours very dark with a light frothy head; looks kind of like a glass of cola. On the nose is pungent alcohol, baker's chocolate, and notable sweetness. Taste is rich and intense: bourbon-soaked raisins and dates, creamy chocolate, and lots of burnt brown sugar. But the barrel character tends to overwhelm those more subtle flavors. It's a milk stout, so mouthfeel is on the thinner side but not too thin: smooth and lightly creamy. Overall, this one suffers from the overpowering barrel character, and all the flavors of the original Jones Dog get snuffed out rather than enhanced.  ",3.75,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,3.62

97487,GJ40,2014-01-08,"   Sampled from a 22oz bottle. Thanks surge1311! This one foamed over upon uncapping it. It didn't explode out but it came in a pretty solid initial flow then continued to bubble for some time. A - A deep golden with a very hazy finish and a big white head (bordering on too big). S - Lots of contributions from the wheat with a grassy, lemony aroma. T - Crisp, clean and dry. Maybe a bit too dry. Nice flavors from the wheat with a slightly tart finish. The maple syrup is faint but contributes. M - A moderate consistency with a high carbonation giving it a lively feel. O - Very refreshing. Between the foam-over and dryness, I think this one over attenuated in the bottle but it was good.  ",3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.6

97487,stakem,2013-12-13,   Bomber into a matching Lawson's snifter. The brew appears a clear golden yellow color with a firm white cap. Some patchy lace sticks to the glass and overall the brew is pretty nice looking. The aroma is grainy wheat with grass and sulfur notes. A little fruity to floral aspect in the back. The nose is pretty simple but clean and enjoyable. The flavor is lightly fruity almost with a hint of something like cider. Some wheat and sulfur are also thrown in there. A faint watered down with a hint of something like earthy maple syrup in the aftertaste. This is a light bodied brew with an effervescent amount of carbonation. A strange and unique combo of character. The fruity apple notes were not expected and didnt quite work.  ,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.48

Wheat and a lasting but not intense sweetness. Some spicey clove. M-Too carbonated. Bubbles expand over the tongue. Very light and otherwise drinkable. Refreshing. O/D-Fairly tasty.

92742,TheManiacalOne,2013-05-26,"   On-tap 3/15/2013 at Track 84 in Warwick, RI, served in a weizen glass. A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. S: The aroma is very faint but contains caramelized malts, some hops and some citrus. T: The taste starts out bready with a hearty but not too heavy malt character. Then some mildly sweet flavors of caramel and citrus come in. The hops presence is decent in strength, distinctly German and brings a good balance. The after-taste is slightly bready and slightly hoppy. M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean. O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to pound down for a very long time.  ",4,3.75,4,4.25,4,3.97
92742,Flounder57,2013-05-11,"   Having on draft at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth. Appearance: This beer poured a small head that reduced to a small layer. It is a thick looking golden straw yellow that looks similar to their hefeweizen. Nice lacing on the glass as the beer was drank. Smell: cloves, bready malts, bananas, and some sweet malts. Taste: Same as above with mild hoppy flavor and bitterness to the beer. Its just a hoppier version of their hefeweizen. Picking up a little citrus and pine in there. Interesting. Mouthfeel: Smooth, full bodied, low to medium carbonation, a little chewy, and a little hop bitterness too. Overall: This beer should be categorized as a hefeweizen, but this one is hoppier than their normal version. Still very tasty.  ",4.25,4,4,4,4,4.02

92742,ThePorterSorter,2013-04-24,"   On tap @ the Blue Monk in Buffalo The beer pours a hazy golden yellow with 1/2 an inch of a fluffy white head that fades quickly and laces. The nose is a sweet honey forward, wheat/corn, yeast, hops (slightly citrusy), and a hint of bubble gum. The taste presents much the same with malty/honey sweetness upfront that becomes more of a banana bread/ripe pear sweetness as it warms, and is carried on by a residual citrusy sweetness...still no true hop presence. It's light-medium bodied, effervescent, easy drinking, slightly yeasty, obviously sweet, sort-of hoppy, but nothing I'd classify as being ""bitter."" This is a slight push towards being a hoppy lager, but I'm unimpressed by the attempt.  ",4.25,3.75,4,4,4,3.96

125646,braker649er,2017-10-21,"   What beautiful beer! L: The name calls it. Lovely orange-cold, thick as juice and cloudy as glacial runoff. S: There's orange but also tropical fruit. I picked up a pine scent similar to how the pith of a mango has pine. T: Juice comes first and... wow! What took me by surprise is that the malt is detectable, too. F: Just so damned smooth. Again, like glacial runoff, but juicy instead. O: Worth seeking this out via a trade. Poured from a can to a tulip glass. Had side-by-side with Spirit Crusher, a similarly hazy DIPA from Seattle's Holy Mountain. Also from a can created about the same time! An interesting East-West experiment with both winning, in my opinion. The New England beer predictably nailed its own style with the aptly named Haze. And the West-coast brew brought Washington state hops to the table in a very similar style. I'd say Spirit Crusher might've been even more orange-juicier, just in the way that it was more like orange-juice concentrate. Maybe more hop bite, too. Like tasting a hop off the vine. ""Haze"" may have been slightly more refined, which is odd to say because both have punch and smoothness. Balance. And surprisingly similar beers!  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.63

97487,maximum12,2013-10-19,"   Thanks to damienblack for this bottle among other eastern treasures; wanted this one the moment I heard about it. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife. The pour, conducted expertly by my 11 year old daughter, is fraught with overcarbonation. Head overtops the two goblets & gets all over my poor daughter, who now smells like beer. Hope the child welfare people don’t stop by. Nose is wheat &…funk? Funk. Not sour, more like saison-level funk. Not liking where this starts up. Lawson’s Maple Wheat is half right, at least. No hint of maple anywhere in the near vicinity. Overwhelming dint of funkiness slashed, but not enough, with grain & raw wheat. The effect is something of a cross between Jolly Pumpkin & a traditional hefe - & it’s not good. The stupid carbonation inhibits what enjoyment I might have been able to pull out of this; 11 ounces is far too much. I can’t believe this was the brewer’s intent. Funk, overcarbonation, missing maple all point to the start of an infection, or something unpleasant. Perhaps my first bad beer from Lawson’s. A drain pour disappointment.  ",2,2.5,2,1.5,1.5,1.97

Allot of bubbles coming off the bottom. Golden/brown color, slight haze appearance. Big bubbles stick to the sides of the glass. S- The aroma is nice, very subtle overall. Clove, banana notes, yeast, malt, spice, slight corn aroma. T- Taste is a little underwhelming. Very similar to the aroma, clove, slight banana, wheat is present, slight yeast characteristic, very light, cannot pick out any maple notes, its refreshing. M- Very light mouthfeel, clean crisp finish, really carbonated. O- Overall would have liked the maple to come out a little more would have made this beer much more interesting. Its not a bad beer, but its not something i would buy again. Should have opened back when the weather was warmer, very refreshing, perfect for the summer.  ",3.75,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.64

Looks viscous. Great aroma. It's smells like s'mores... Graham cracker, chocolate, toasted marshmallow. Heavy oak and vanilla characteristics. BT is my go to bourbon so I'm excited for the taste. It doesn't disappoint. Heavy vanilla and chocolate. Char to a lesser extent. Woody, toffee, molasses. It pulls the heavy spicy rye characteristic and displays it in a long finish. Heavy and lingering sweetness in the mouthfeel. Boozy but smooth. Well done. Dispute the price tag I'm glad it's a 12oz serving. It's quite filling but delicious.  ",4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.3

104824,Alieniloquium,2014-03-19,"   12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Appearance - Pours without a head on a black body, just a bit of transparency at the edges. Smell - Lots of oak. Huge barrel character. Bourbon. Some chocolate and a bit of molasses and caramel behind it. Taste - Again, it's almost all barrel. Oak and a sharp bourbon flavor. The bourbon flavor never diminishes, although the oak flavor comes back in the end with a bite. Molasses more prominent with some dark chocolate that never reaches the fudge-y heights of Game of Jones. A little bit of lactose sweetness lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel - Booze and barrel all over this. Medium-low carbonation. A sipper for sure. Overall - If you like bourbon-dominated beers, this is for you. If you like to taste the beer back there, this is not for you. I happen to really like bourbon, although I think I would prefer to drink it straight over this.  ",3,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.56

104824,mfnmbvp,2014-03-12,"   12 oz. bottle, with handwritten Batch #75 on the label. Ah yes, at long last I have finally acquired one of these elusive barrel aged Pipeworks offerings. The label lists this as Tales From The Oak - The Jones Dog. ""Bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with cacao and vanilla added"". My expectations are interstellar; Pipeworks makes some of my favorite stouts. It's probably gonna be pretty epic. Poured into a clear balloon snifter. A - Straight pour down the center produces no head, just a few mocha bubbles. Body is a dark woodsy mahogany-cola color; just a few shades away from black. Some sticky alcohol lacing when given a swirl in the glass. Looks very nice. S - Ah yes, this thing smells truly amazing. I would dare to say this smells nearly as good as Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout, if maybe a touch boozier. Bourbon booze heat, woodsy barrel character, creamy vanilla, fudgey chocolate, cookie dough, & hints of tart rum soaked dark fruit. T - Absolutely delicious; everything I hoped it would be. Smooth creamy vanilla, fudgey chocolate / cacao, roasted coffee bean bitterness, earthy / woodsy barrel character, bourbon alcohol heat, caramel / toffee, and some hints of dark boozy fruit (raisin, date, plum, green apple). Delicious. M - Feel is silky smooth and creamy. Sticky & sugary - it would make an ideal dessert beer. Full bodied with extremely low lying carbonation. Moderately high 11.00% abv is mildly apparent, but tolerable. Overall, it was nothing short of delicious, however I think Pipeworks is capable of making even better barrel aged stouts than this. There is no telling what amazing things these guys will do in the future. Definitely one of my favorite Pipeworks beers I've had the privilege of drinking, and probably the best of their stouts so far. One of my favorite beers from one of my favorite breweries. Highly recommended, I can't wait to get more of these. Pipeworks Barrel Aged Imperial Jones Dog ---4.5/5  ",4,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.79

Taste is pretty bright kiwi initially quickly being joined by the dulled must, malt and sourness combo. Tart feel with plenty of lingering dryness. Overall a pretty solid sour ale.

S: Smell and flavor are very connected and have a clear base of peach, the fruit is very clear. T: As with smell the base is peach and then the backbone of malts, hops are almost not present. M: Manly sweet due to the fruit, but sensation is not exuberant as could be.  ",,,,,,3.82

Walnuts, chocolate, coffee and a tinge of booze. My goodness, immediately catapulted to the top of my favorite stout list. The walnuts, coffee and chocolate and playing games with me. I think I may fall over. Here comes some smoke. Then tobacco. This gets better with every sip. Thick and oily. I don't want it to leave. It is as proper as a stout could feel. Wonderful.

There really isn't a lot of visible carbonation here. This leaves the glass oily and slick. The aroma is incredibly nice. There's plenty of dark roasted malt character, sweet vanilla and whipped cream, mild coffee, and nut character. Complete and decadent. The flavor, too, is stunning. It's rich, roasty, creamy, and complex (earth, vanilla, whipped cream, and nut). The flavors are well integrated and the alcohol is well hidden though not completely masked. Very nice. Medium to full bodied with very low carbonation. Creamy and incredibly drinkable. Simply fantastic.  ",3.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,4.49

Pours an opaque black with a dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, nuts, sweet vanilla, and wood. Taste is exactly the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great aromas and flavors.  ",3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.34

A bit of pepper undertones Taste- Really nice sweetness. Starts off with Melon and Earthiness. Flavor crescendos into sweetness like biting into a juicy peach. You can taste the hoppiness of this beer without a major bite. It's really enjoyable Feel- carbonation and fullness really shine. Tree house is known for creaminess. This may be the best they offer in this regard. Overall- a real sleeper. Very drinkable. The feel as good as anything out there. Just quality.

125814,mactrail,2018-04-29,"   Clear golden color with a brief wisp of foam in the chalice. Aroma of lemon is quite pleasant. Lacking in any sort of yeasty aromatics even though they call it a Hefeweizen; correctly categorized as an American Pale Wheat. The mouthfeel is crisp and feather light. It could have more carbonation for a near flavorless beer. This is more promising than the couple of other brews I've had from this place. Not much to brag about, though it's a perfectly gulpable beverage if you like the kiss of fruit. Current version in the 12 oz can is 5% ABV. From a northern Washington beer store.  ",3.5,3.5,3.25,3.25,3,3.28

125814,Lone_Freighter,2017-06-20,"   Poured into a weizen glass, the appearance was a soft semi-burnt bronzed golden color that had about a two and a half finger's worth of white foamy head that slid off at a moderate pace. Some speckled lace ran here and there, somewhat clingy but also sliding at the same time. The aroma shaped some super light banana esters against the normal clove spices, but seemed to come across somewhat light. Light bubblegum and sweet wheat slide in for a decent blend. The flavor was moderately sweet through the bubblegum, banana esters and sweet wheat. But once again, not very bold as I would have hoped for. Aftertaste had a touch of the sweet wheat and bubblegum. The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt a bit more prickly than expected. The clove spice even had a bit more of unxexpected harshness to me. ABV did feel appropriate. Overall, not a Weihenstephaner in any sense, but somewhat worthy, perhaps. Maybe again for me.  ",3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.49

Thick frothy white head dissipates steadily leaving a residual thin layer of foam and lots of sticky white lacing behind. For the NE style IPA this is an excellent appearance. Smell is pungent and permeating - strong notes of orange, tangerine, peach, mango and passionfruit all are noted. Taste follows the nose with lots of strong citrus flavors - orange, tangerine, and grapefruit - along with some peach and mango initially. Quickly transitions to some English biscuit like malt, some grassy hop notes, and dry hopped flavors. Almost no bitterness although you certainly get lots of hops flavors. Feel is medium to full bodied, thick, yet extremely drinkable. Moderate carbonation is perfect for the heft of this beer. Smooth dry finish. Overall this is a fantastic NE style IPA from Tree House. Certainly lives up to the expectations.  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.53

Aromatics are lush with fresh peach and orange sherbet. Medium bodied with a creamy, soft mouthfeel. Peaches, orange, and candied grapefruit on the palate. Minimal bitterness, zero malt, and quite dry. Finishes with lingering tropical fruit. Great beer.

The taste is a deep tropical/dank/bitter combination with pineapple, mango, and even a bit of coconut. There's some of peach in there also. The mouthfeel is thick and velvety for a 5.75% APA.

A little dank. The taste is a little more Mosaic than Citra- pine, resin, grapefruit, orange, lemon, light lime, a little melon, malt. A good amount of bitterness throughout, and again, a little dank. Smooth, well carbonated, a good body. There’s no doubt this is all about the Citra and Mosaic.

Overall: Great IPA. The hop bill is nothing new, but the malt/rye backbone sets it apart from the standard West Coast style IPA. I had this from a freshly tapped keg and was blown away.

This one goes down easy with big points in the drinkability column. Hoppiness really comes through - IPA yes. Have had other ryes in the past where the rye really dominates. While I like that extreme, not really getting that here, though the beer is quite good. Carbonation is just north of mild. Sipping this one well chilled on a hot Southern California evening, this one hits the spot tonight.

The aroma was a very nicely balanced blend of grain and hops that, while distinct, melded together nicely. Sadly, there was just a slight bit of cattiness that I found a bit off-putting. On the tongue however, the beer was all full, earthy grains and crisp hops that complemented each other very nicely indeed. The beer had a bit of a tart hop finish that lingered for a few moments. No sign of the kitty. The body was nicely medium, very smooth, easy and crisp. Drinkability was excellent, you could drink these all afternoon long and not get fatigued or bored. Overall, a very good take on the style that borders on excellent. A must try if you see it and worth a trip to the breweries tasting room if you happen to be in the Seattle area.  ",,,,,,3.58

The taste has a tinge of caramel malt with spice in the intial flavor with hint of yeast adding a fruity dried apricot element with mild floral tinges and slight peppery alcohol taste in the finish.

197154,dd43,2015-12-27,"   I think this particular style is not well understood by a lot of beer drinkers. As the name suggests, this is a beer built to be paired with a midday meal. Per the style, it is low on carbonation, is decidedly malty, not overly pronounced hop bitterness, and easy to drink in terms of relatively low ABV. Pours with almost no head, which is understandable given how low the carbonation level is. Color of iced tea, and similarly hazed. Aroma is not pungent, but rather sweetly malty, like a lightly sweet biscuit or sweetened bread crust. Definitely a grain forward beer, flavor wise as well. Bready notes throughout, like whole wheat bread. Really pleasant to drink, no booze notes whatsoever. Goes down quickly and easily, the perfect libation to quench one's parchment after a hearty traditional english lunch of meat cheese and bread. Cheers!  ",4,3.75,4,4,4,3.94

Many bubbles rise to the top of the glass that boasts a fluffy, white head that has good retention and leaves a nice amount of soapy lace behind. The aroma is simple and while it showcases the ingredients, does come across a bit blandly, light hop spice, lots of banana bread with just slight maple and earthy bark profiles with some cracked wheat that lingers. A nice amount of mapley banana bread on the tongue, high levels of pale wheat grain, tree bark, a bit of crisp hop oil but the beer definitely reads as both sweet and savory with a lot of earthiness. The body is crisp, lively coats the mouth well. It comes across as very full bodied for such a light beer, which I really liked, the finish is nice, a bit prickly but quite smooth. Verdict: An interesting experiment, but I'm not sure this one really works. The maple presence is very soft and mild and doesn't really compliment the wheat, but it's saving grace is that the beer is quite refreshing. A rare blemish on Lawson's fine record of producing great beer.  ",4.5,3,3.25,4.25,3.25,3.37

Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, spice, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and spice flavors on the finish.

97487,scotorum,2013-08-18,"   Six ounce draft at the Prohibition Pig pub in Waterbury Vermont, with dinner. a: Clear amber with a finger thick white head which shrank away to a thin surface foam film. t: To be honest, I only had a few sips of this, it was ordered for my beer-hating wife in hopes the maple flavor would appeal to her, while giving Curious George (me, my name was changed to protect me from warranted lawsuits) a chance to try another Lawsons offering. Maple flavor was almost non-existent, although the color was maple syrupish and there were subtle undertones of such. However, I liked it well enough, and she did actually drink most of it, which is no mean feat for a brewer to get my wife to do. So kudos to Lawson's, who probably had the wisdom to recognize that maple syrup and beer naturally do not mix very well flavorwise. m: Light to moderate. Quite smooth. o: Seemed like more of a low-hopped pale ale with a hint of maple flavoring than the wheat beer dominated by maple syrup which one might expect. But it's an interesting and good-tasting brew. Perhaps it should be renamed Lawson's Lawless Liquid or Moonshine Through A Maple Tree or The-Beer-Scotorum's-Wife-Actually-Drank-Five-Ounces-Of or something else which might make it irresistible. It may be too good to just call it what it is.  ",4,3.5,4,3.75,4,3.86

276550,JerzDevl2000,2017-08-20,"   Bought this from Other Half a while ago and finally got around to it tonight. No date on the bottom this particular can though I realize that was over 4 months old by the time I cracked it open. Amazingly smooth and easy to drink, this easily ranked among the upper echelon of Other Half's offerings, which would be saying quite a lot! The pour to this was solid - murky, apricot, and topped off with a light and long-lasting spider web of a head. Not a lot of lacing was left behind though as there were only a few spots that remained on the side of my teku glass. Dank stone fruit, tangerine pith, and pineapple were in the nose with much more of those in the taste. Smooth and juicy, the citra could easily be felt from the first sip as the other, softer hops combined with the oats and alcohol to give this a muddled, depth and murkiness that lied underneath the surface. That slowly transitioned into a creamy sweetness as the lactose took hold, almost making this feel like a dessert beer when all was said and done. A light amount of carbonation ensured that the bubbles would stay in the background to odd-but-pleasing flavor profile of this brew that grew on me as I worked my way through this. This had enough alcohol in it but it wasn't too overpowering or a detraction. Rather, the heft of it enhanced the chewy mouthfeel and full body that this carried, down to the lingering slickness and sweetness that was oh-so-pleasing. What a winner here and a pleasure for those who love nuanced IPA's. Oats and spelt are great if used right, which was certainly the case here!  ",4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.43

92925,ThisWangsChung,2014-08-25,"   12 oz bottle into a wine glass. Appearance: Pours a murky chestnut color. The head is a finger high and off-white in shade. Its creamy texture retains fairly well, leaving a nice collar behind, as well as some lacing. (3.5) Smell: From first whiff, I can immediately tell these brewers were influenced by Schlafly's pumpkin ale - and I can't think of a better beer to be influenced by. I'm picking up plenty of vanilla, brown sugar, and molasses; while auxiliary notes of cinnamon and allspice stay in the background where they belong. There is a slight gourd character, too. One of the better pumpkin beers I've encountered, at least on the nose. (4) Taste: Aye...it didn't translate down to the taste buds that well. It starts off with that vanilla/brown sugar/molasses trifecta the nose indicated; on the other hand, the back end sees an upsurge of strong cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg. Once the palate properly adjusts to all the spicing, I'm actually starting to pick up a solid pumpkin flavor. After half a bottle, I finally start 'getting' this beer: it tastes less like pumpkin pie and more like...well, actual pumpkin. This deserves good marks for nailing the style guidelines quite well. It's not a glorified pumpkin soda, it's not a desserty pumpkin pie in a glass, it's just a beer with pumpkin and some spices (this is a compliment). (3.5) Mouthfeel: Despite the fuller body, it leans closer to dry than lush. No doubt, this is all helped by its decent carbonation...maybe TOO decent? At first, the drinkability is somewhat daunting thanks to the powerful spicing; after opening up, it becomes quite easy to down. (3.5) Overall: Oh man. If only this beer lived up to the aroma, it could have really given Schlafly's pumpkin ale a run for its money. Still, it's a rock-solid pumpkin ale, one that walks all over the lesser examples. Very well done, but it won't convert pumpkin ale haters thanks to its hefty spice characteristic. (3.5) 3.6/5: Solid pumpkin ale...but if only it tasted like it smelled...if only...  ",,,,,,3.6

92925,woodychandler,2014-01-26,"   My local, in-person trader, tone77, dropped this off for me recently, thus ensuring that my year of the pumpkin is not going to ever end. I like the style, but as with all styles, not all beers are created equal. From the bottle: ""Obscenely Fresh""; ""Hand Crafted""; ""If you drink like a fish swim home, don't drive - Fin City cares about you ... Drink responsibly!""; ""A tasty Brown Ale made with American malts, 100% real pumpkin, molasses, brown sugar and spices."" I will say this for it, following an initial pour - it smells pretty good! Once I had it all into the glass, I was looking at just over a finger of rocky, tawny head with decent retention. Color was more of a hazy orange (SRM = &gt; 17, &lt; 22) than a brown ale as noted on the label. The nose was intensely sweet with the molasses and brown sugar really taking the lead. I am curious as to how this will play out as I am not usually a fan of sweet anything, but conversely, I have had some pumpkin beers that were spiced to the point of saturation and I did not like them, either. Some nice lacing formed as the head fell while I was typing and so it was time for my first draught. Mouthfeel was medium and I was definitely getting cinnamon and nutmeg in the mouth, but the sweetness was there, just not in a cloying state. Hmmm. I was finding it quite quaffable and it was going down the hatch rather quickly. The finish had a pleasant dryness borne of all of the spices. It was not alum dry, but it was nowhere near as sweet as the nose had led me to believe.  ",3.5,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.77

Light ring of bubbles that quickly fades Nose is toasted malts. Nothing special here but I'm actually glad I'm not blasted by spice, clove et al This is a nicely balanced pumpkin ale... I am not the type who usually likes the pumpkin-pie spiced out beers, but this one is balanced nicely. This dude won contests with this brew for a reason; the Madagascar vanilla beans and 100% pumpkin shine through, and using reserve with the spice has thing thing tasting more like Pumking than any other bollocks out there... The flavor is balanced in such a way that you can put down a few of these. It's a solid brew that i'd have again and recommend to all  ",4.25,4,4.5,3.5,4.25,4.22

125646,kevanb,2017-09-02,"   16oz can, purchased from the Brewery, not sure the date, but known to be very fresh. Poured into a Tree House snifter glass. Enjoyed on 3.20.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a very turbid golden color with orange hues that is very reminiscent of a glass of orange juice. A thick finger of white head rises with good retention and lots of spotted lace. The aroma is very nice, lots of citrus, orange and grapefruit with some tropical pineapple, a bit of wildflower, sweet yeast, pale dough and some dank pine at the finish. The flavors really explode, lots of bitter pine up front, grassy hops, hop spice, grapefruit peel offer some more spicy bitterness with some refreshing tropical fruit juice with a sweet finish, pale grain, lightly yeasty. The mouthfeel is great, coating, creamy, medium body that has nice life to it with a dry and bitter finish. Verdict: A very nice DIPA from Tree House. Refreshing, bursting with flavor, well balanced, and as it warms, some pleasant bitterness comes out to contrast against the sweeter nature of the this beer which is much needed.  ",4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,4.21

Offers a very intriguing hop profile on the nose, with a gentle diversity between herbs, grass, orange and lime zest. Got a nice sweet note from toffee malts, nicely adding to the juiciness of the fruits. Very refreshing, light bodied, well balanced with a soft effervescence and a challenging, perfectly integrated hop bite at the back end. Tastes of toffee accompanied lime zest, immediately establishing a hoppy dryness, thriving more complexity from a supportive grass note. Offers a short mineralic hint during midpalate, enhancing the hop presence in this, while the malts grow more profound as well. After the swallow this turns immediately surprisingly bitter, the hops now officially dominate the flavors with just a light note of sweet toffee cutting through. Very well made pale. Its hop flavors are challenging and diverse, while keeping everything in great balance. Can drink this all night, and it pairs very well with hearthy food.  ",4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.27

125646,captaincoffee,2017-08-09,"   Fresh can from the brewery. Super excited to get this on the random day I was heading to TH. I was surprised how similar this is to Julius. Pours a very hazy pale orange like watered down orange juice. Medium head that has very good retention and tons of lace sticking everywhere. Unlike some murky NE IPAs, this remains bright despite being super hazy. Nose is slightly bigger than Julius, but still didn't quite match what I expected based on what I'd previously heard. Nice orange zest, some tropical notes, and certainly yeastier than I expected. Taste is a little bolder with durian being the main fruit I get. Plenty of citrus and again that yeasty note. Mouthfeel is really pleasant and soft while still popping on the tongue like citrus pop rocks. Overall, a great beer that didn't quite match the hype but was still a great experience.  ",4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.29

Smell was a bit muted from what I was expecting but you get a nice nose full of papaya and peach plus a hint of grass/onion. Some orange comes out as well but more so from when it is in the can than the glass. Tastes of pine, grapefruit, melon with a bitter backbone. Remarkably smooth despite the bitterness, very soft, modestly carbonated. No way you would know this is 8.2%. No doubt one of the best beers I've had in my life. TreeHouse is a hike for me but, this one was well worth the drive! If you have it, treasure it. If you don't, make the effort to get your hands on this.  ",4.5,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.47

Above average foamy layered lacing along the sides of the glass. Good-to-great retention on the top all the way down. Smelled earthy rye hops, wet Cascade hops, cantaloupe, sweetened iced tea, green peas, light asparagus, broccoli, corn chips and some caramel notes. Tasted a tad better than the smell, but still not that great. Got those earthy rye hops again to lead. Also buttery notes, cantaloupe, lemon grass, honey, sweetened iced tea, citrus hops, caramel, cough drops, lemon and some vegetable notes. Felt like a kind of cheap taste, but grew on me as it went down. Medium-to-light body. Oily texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. Could hardly taste the alcohol. This rye IPA really grew on me. Not too bad and a great value for the price ($4.29).  ",3.75,3.25,3.75,4,3.75,3.66

47604,DefenCorps,2013-04-13,"   A mildly hazy orange amber with a dense, off-white head, this is a decent looking IPA, The nose is quite solid, a moderate rye character along with some grapefruit and pine hops, this also has some tropical fruit character. Malt character is mild, a little bit of caramel is present. The rye is rather bready too. The palate opens with a blend of rye and grapefruit and a little bit of chalk. Bitterness is moderate, and there's a pleasant blend of fruit and pine. A touch of soap as well. The mid-palate is where the rye comes to play, rather spicy and bready. Sweetness is medium- medium-low with some honey present. Moderately drying and mildly bitter on the finish, there are lingering flavors of fruit and pine, this beer is a little watery.

47604,maximum12,2013-04-13,"   Thanks to kyle2k10 for this bottle, one of about 98 extras from his box that I'm working through. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife after a good dinner out for my daughter's birthday this week...& watching my Twins get crushed. Again. Still. Plus, it's snowing. In mid-April. /end news feed. Pour is a dull orange that's about fourteen percent occluded; not quite cold filtered. Lowly carbonation. Nose is extremely earthy, mixed with tablespoons of lemon & citrus & orange. I'd say: appealing. Rustic Rye IPA is like biting into a piece of South Dakota farmland. Earthiness crosses into a swampy with dry, brittle windblown leaves in the mix. Mid-palate the hops arrive in good humor: pine, citrus. Orange, even. Finish is a sweeping, gentle bitterness & a final herbal potpourri. Half a bomber of this will do just fine, thanks. This veers towards saison territory...well, not real close, but much closer than most beers with 'rye' or 'IPA' on the label. Best thing one can say about the beer is it's...interesting.

276550,Meyers1023,2017-07-12,"   Was lucky enough to have this both from a can and on draft. Absolutely amazing! It is a cloudy orange color with just about a fingers worth of foamy white head. The smell knocks you back as soon as it is poured. Full of candied citrus fruit with a small amount of dough and alcohol to finish off the nose. The flavor is a huge juice bomb upfront before easing into a bit of bitterness to even things out. The feel is a little thick and smooth from the oats and lactose. Again, an outstanding collaboration from two of the better IPA makers!  ",4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.59

T- Tastes ver much the same as it smells. The alcohol is very present. Really hot, could use some time to mellow out. Vanilla, brown sugar, really sweet. M- Silky smooth finish, big mouthfeel.

104824,MNishCT77,2013-12-27,"   12 oz. bottle purchased at West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, IL; unknown bottling date but batch #75, shared with my wife over an hour while playing Uno A: 3/3 - deep dark brown-to-black with some purplish hues around the edges; initial small amount of carbonation settles into a lack of head (expected for a barrel-aged beer), big alcohol legs (again, to be expected at 12% ABV) S - 10/12 - Buffalo Trace bourbon notes - vanilla, tobacco, leather - with some background dark malts of the base milk stout; big alcohol aroma as well T: 17/20- the barrel-aged qualities are front and center on this one and complement the aroma - again, intense vanilla and brown sugar sweetness; in the middle of the mouth, the sweetness continues to lie within and, for me, becomes a bit overpowering (albeit my wife loved it); still it finishes with little residual sweetness; although it doesn't taste like 11% ABV, it definitely brings the heat like that Asian sugar baby wouldn't M - 4/5 - the wood-aged and bourbon presence is thick on the tongue with alcohol; low carbonation per style O: 8/10 - never had a milk/sweet stout barrel-aged before so kudos to Pipeworks for venturing out; as much as I love the notes from the BT barrel, it's too sweet for my tastes, but, for the right person with the right food or other accompaniment, this could be a great dessert beer to sip in front of a fire or in bed; not a bad deal either for $7.99 TOTAL - 41/50  ",4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.59

97487,bonkers,2013-08-10,"   Thanks to my cousin Jeff for picking this one up for me. Pours a pale straw with a big foamy head. The aroma is sweet, with lots of spices. The beer taste like a below average wheat beer, some bubble gum, a little spice. I do not taste any maple. The beer is light, effervescent, and easy drinking. I was expecting more out of this brew, it was graded so harshly due to it lacking any maple flavor at all.  ",3.75,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,3.24
97487,plaid75,2013-08-09,"   On draft at Prohibition Pig, Waterbury, VT. Poured a hazy bright straw hue with a one ginger got white head. There was good retention and lacing. The smell was devoid of any maple element and essentially left me with some wheat spice and weak esters. The trade was likewise bland, with maple to be had. The mouthfeel was toward the lighter side of the style. Overall a poor beer considering the expected maple element.  ",4,3,3,3.25,3.25,3.14

125646,sulldaddy,2017-07-30,"   Sampling my first Tree House beer. Excited to check out the hype and experience the brewery. Have some cans of other examples waiting for me. Pouring the can cold into a snifter, the beer is a cloudy orange juice color with no light passing through my glass. A bleached white creamy head of 2 cm rests on the surface of my glass and remains as a sturdy surface layer throughout the sampling. The foam leaves dense lattice on the sides of my glass after each sip. Aroma is lots of fruit with some peach and apricot mixing with grapefruit and some orange as well. A little bit of rindy pith scents but otherwise fairly sweet and fruity on the nose. The first sip reveals a light body with very tingly carbonation and a smooth texture. The beer drinks very easy and is physically no challenge to consume. The flavor is all hops with lots of fruit notes throughout the sampling. I get hits of peach and grapefruit and then the middle is pithy citrus rind and slightly bitter flavor. This gives way quickly to a very orange flavor that is fairly sweet and lingers citrus on my palate. I do get sort of bready and creamsicle flavored burps occasionally but I dont get any detection of the 8.2% on the can. Very drinkable brew and definitely depicting juice characteristic throughout the stages of sampling. Definitely worth trying if NE IPA/NE DIPA is your thing, but also pretty enjoyable for anyone.  ",4,4.5,4.5,5,4.25,4.47

252952,Lone_Freighter,2017-06-05,"   Poured into a mug, the appearance was a deep muddled burnt orange color with a thin cap of a white to off white foamy head that dissipated fairly quick. Moderately concave lacing hit the sides decently. The aroma starts off caramel and toffee malty sweet with some grassy sweet to bitter hops balancing in nicely. Slight dried clean earthiness. The flavor balances nicely between the earthy and grassy hops to the clean sweet caramel, toffee and bready malts. Very clean and nice. Superb clean malty aftertaste with a touch of nuttiness. Quick semi-sweet caramel-esque finish gracing a touch of the grassy hops. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Mild carbonation yields to the grassy hop bitterness having enough harshness. Overall, good Oktoberfest that I wouldn’t mind having again and perhaps with some soft pretzels and spicy mustard or even some bratwursts. Definitely a food beer.  ",3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.59

I can't help but wonder about the name; is it a play on Seven Up? Maybe. A session ale? Crushable? Yes and yes.

Smell is pretty fruit, some oranges and grapefruit, but fairly sweet and malty, not aggressively hoppy. Some rye spiciness too. Taste is fairly bitter, not as much citrus as on the nose, lots of rye spice again and even more sweet maltiness. Pretty good but needs more hop and less malt. Lots and lots of fizzy carb, pretty full body, good mouthfeel overall. Good beer! Not remarkable but a solid rye IPA which is a style I always like. 6.8/10  ",3.25,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.34

A - pours a clear golden with a copper hint. Good carbonation and inch thick head of large bubbles that last for a short period and then disapate back into the beer. S - After a day walking around Disneyland this is the grand finale of the day. Excellent hop aroma. Fruity, citrus, grapefruit and a peppery smell T - Tastes as I imagined. Balanced hops, malt, rye fruitiness and pepper with a smooth bitterness. Tastes like a homebrew I made but drier. O - Worth the price to try a local brew made by a homebrewer recently turned craft brewer. Wish I could try more from Bootlegger's.  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.45

Finishes very bitter and dry with lingering resinous hop flavors. M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation and slight chewiness. O - I gotta say that i'm pleasantly surprised by this beer. Rye didn't jump out at me, but i found the beer to be a satisfying IPA, filled with resins and bitterness. Inviting look, and the price is outstanding.

Aroma: Aroma was pleasant but once again, nothing special. It was also subtle. Specific smells included rye, orange, pine, and honey. Flavor: The flavor is what got me. I feel it had the perfect balance between piney hops and bitterness. The specific flavors I could taste were pine, rye, orange, wheat, honey, copper, and nuts. Very crisp. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel was also amazing. It was creamy, plentiful amounts of small bubbles on the tongue, and a thick body. Overall: Perfect type of beer I'd like to drink on a hot day, but would also be amazing slightly below room temperature. This is nowhere near the hoppiest or the most bitter IPA I've ever had, but it is perfectly balanced.  ",3,3.75,5,5,4.75,4.53

There is some faint tropical fruits but rye dominates. The flavors are compromised of a ton of rye. Spice, earthiness, and lovliness.

97487,GarthDanielson,2013-08-08,"   Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, unfiltered, orange-gold coloring, almost opaque, with a filmy, bright white head. Nose of toasted wheat, subtle citrus notes, maple sweetness, and hints of smoke. Flavors of smooth, roasted wheat, with a rich, roasty sweet maple backbone. Very balanced and smooth. Light, crisp citrus notes on the tail end of the palate. Smooth and slightly effervesced body. The aftertaste is tangy sweet with citrus highlights, and the finish is smooth and clean. Very easy to drink.  ",4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.12

97487,Hendry,2013-08-06,"   Cloudy orange amber,soft two finger white head, laces well in the glass. Aromas are decidedly European,yeast most particularly,maple nonexistent as are the hops. Sour splash to the palate on the first sip, reminiscent of a yeasty Belgian, and quickly changes over to a lager flavor profile while at the same time the slightest coating of maple finishes at the back. Medium bodied, perfect carbonation, nice mouthfeel. Okay, I love Lawson's, and have been a fan of their past maple offerings, but Maple Wheat takes an artisan approach that is certainly a different take on the style. While Maple Wheat may appeal to others with a more adventurous palate than mine, I found it interesting and worth trying once.  ",4.25,3.75,4,4,4,3.96

47604,WestCoastLibations,2012-12-07,"   For my first(!) review here on Beer Advocate, I wanted to pay homage to a local (of sorts) brewery, based in Fullerton, Orange County. While I am familiar with DTF, and the trifling nonsense which goes on there, I have always been interested in the city's brewery, which this beer gave me the perfect opportunity to get to know! Flowing out of the deuce-deuce, the beer came out the same color of the Fall leaves in the recent Charlie Brown Thanksgiving Special I just watched, yet when settled in the glass (proper IPA glass of course), the beer took on a darker color, almost Brown. From here, I knew it was going to be delicious. Sniffing it as the head decreased to mere layer of white, topping the abyss below, it smelled to me almost tame, with the Rye acting as a barrier of sorts from the onslaught some IPA's can bring. Finally tasting the sweet nectar, I was admittedly surprised by the lack of bitterness, which again, accompany many IPA's. While there was no shortage of Hops, there was still a cacophony of other tastes combined, going to create a unique, and...well...delicious flavor. Overall, with the combination of appearance, smell, taste, and personal notes, I was happy with the product which was sampled through 22 ounces, and about 15 minutes of bliss on a Friday afternoon. This taste from Bootleggers will most almost certainly bring me up the 55 Freeway sometime soon, to check out the brewery itself, nestled in the forest, known as DownTown Fullerton!  ",4.5,4,4,4,4,4.03

Pale orange and clear with a bubbly white adhesive head, about a half finger thick. Looks kind of like a pumpkin in color actually. Sweet almost candy-like orange flavors right up front and through the finish. It's almost like those gummi orange wedges covered in sugar. Nice spiciness from the rye hits the sides of my tongue and dances around. Slick mouthfeel, almost feels a bit wrong, but it works. Carbonation is low to moderate.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.53

T - Starts off with a mix of sweet caramel malts with some grapefruit, orange, and citrus hops with some bitterness. Through the middle, some light pine hop comes through with a bit more bitterness and some rye spiciness. The finish is a mix of sweet caramel and biscuit malts, rye spiciness, and some citrus and light pine hops. M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain/rye and some very mild herbal hop aromas. Taste is slightly sweet and is of malt/grain/rye up front with some herbal hops on the finish and a slight alcohol kick with each sip. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but the smell is pretty weak in my opinion.  ",4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.41

Very grassy, weedy hop aroma, not much pine or bitterness apparent. Pale malt is hiding behind the mildly spicy rye malt. That rye malt is very apparent in the flavor. Again, mildly spicy, full of flavor. I get a little butterscotch diacetyl, which I realize was in the aroma too, but I just couldn't place it. That grassy hop aroma comes out in the flavor as well. Not as bitter as I would expect an IPA to be, but it's definitely got some bitterness to it. Balanced feel, slightly dry finish. Interesting, but I'm ultimately nonplussed by this beer. Rather spend my money on something else.  ",3,2,3,3,2.5,2.66

47604,Auracom,2012-05-31,"   Big thanks to Derek for the extra! 12 oz. poured into a Stone Old Guardian glass on May 16th, 2012. A - Lightly-hazy, dark-golden coloring. One and a 1/2 fingers of a vanilla-white head. Poor retention but good lacing. S - Relaxed aromas of citrus, notably orange juice and overripe lemons. There's just a hint of rye-like spices. Tiny bit of hop-cone pine tree, but it doesn't smell all that west coast. T - Further citrus and light pineyness. Spices are non-existent here. At rear palate there's a weird, exceedingly-bitter, warhead-candy sourness that feels very disjointed from the rest of the drink. It went from being subpar in reference to the typical to bizarre and atyipcal. M - Light-medium body, moderate-high carbonation. Astringent but doesn't finish very dry. D - I refuse to believe there's rye in this when I think back to other rye IPA's like Alpine Nelson. Not likely to visit this one again.  ",3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,2.26

47604,Drinkerofales,2012-05-11,"   The beer is clear, golden amber, with a huge light tan head that leaves tons of spiderweb lacing and takes a while to dissipate. Smells of grapefruit pith, warm malts and some rye as well. Taste is not quite as big, lightly bitter pith throughout, with a rye aftertaste. The two go well together, but the flavors are a little understated. Texture is light-medium bodied, a light bite, with a semi long dry finish. Medium drinkability, I probably wouldn't want more than one or two of these. The taste is somewhat lacking in actual hop flavor, as the only aspect is the citrus pith. Other than that, it's what it says it is, and does a pretty good job of it. DOA  ",4.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.83

It smells like a fruit smoothie. Taste: right upfront your smacked with fresh squeezed orange juice and juicy tangerine. Middle of the mouth tropical fruits come in to play peach flesh, mango, papaya a little bit of passionfruit.The flavors in the mid plate play with the creaminess of the beer to give it a fresh picked tropical fruit salad taste. The beer finishes with more of those citrus notes. Yellow grapefruit and orange. Some bubblegum, along with a light grassy earthy bitterness. Feel: Medium body. Moderate to full creaminess. Super soft. The beer just glides across the plate. Overall: Drinking this I can understand the treehouse hype. The hops in this beer are used to make a fruit bomb. the creaminess in the beer gives it a fruit smoothie like flavor in the mid plate. Almost no bitterness or malt presence. This is an A+ beer.

The appearance lived up to it’s name, definitely orange haziness colored with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that leveled off at a nice pace. Sly thin lacing forms around the sides evenly. The aroma starts off with a bright and juicy orange juice, pulpy with big bitter balancing rind-like qualities. Sweet onion dankiness slides in for an extra ferocity of the aroma. The flavor brings it all together bittersweet with a spectacular orange juice to sweet onion aftertaste. Excellent sweet to danky finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a smooth sweet to bitter feel rolling over my tongue. Nothing clings, just feels absolutely awesome as it hits my tongue. Overall, hot damn, what an absolutely amazing DIPA. I would definitely have again.  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.55

Look: Pours a beautiful opaque gold, thin white head of foam, heavy lace. Smell: Intense piney aromas right away, but with a subtle sweetness that creeps up on you. Distinct notes of tangerine and grapefruit also clearly present. UPDATE: emergence of guava in the smell, not easily noticeable right away, but very apparent in the back of the nose. Amazing. Taste: Again, very hop forward but equally matched in flavor by an intensely bitter grapefruit balance that is unmistakable. Feel: Incredibly smooth and drinkable, I would never guess that the ABV clocked in at 8.2%. This beer is truly unique and incredible. It pours an amazing golden color and the smell is subtle but so potent. At first, with such an amazing look and smell, the mild flavors almost took me back! But after a few more sips and a bit of warmth, it really transformed. Can't get over how smooth this DIPA is, really remarkable.

Look - Pours a cloudy copper amber with a good sized foamy head that dissipates at a medium pace and retains some. Good lacing. Smell - Aroma is a decidedly rich pilsner aroma with some sour wheat. Notes of maple are quite subtle (unfortunately). Taste - Dry, crisp, and refreshing as hell. The brew redeems the lack of maple interplay here with a nice yeast blend and a good body with a little carbonated snap. Very subtle on maple again here but it turns out well anyway. Mouthfeel - Dry and more light bodied than medium. Zero booziness. Slightly sticky from the maple. Great drinkability. Overall - This wins in this niche sub category for its attention to detail and delicate balanced infusion of maple with wheat. Terrific brew.  ",4,3.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.08

I can't really make out anything else over it. Taste: At first it tastes like carbonated water flavored with artificial orange, like La Croix. A tiny bit of soapy malt comes in at the end, just enough to remind you that it's beer. Mouthfeel: Very thin and highly carbonated. Again, like carbonated water. Overall: While not really offensive, it's incredibly boring. It tastes less like beer and more like someone put a little bit of flavoring in a bottle of sparkling water.  ",3.5,3,3,2.5,2.75,2.93

97183,Phyl21ca,2014-02-20,   Bottle: Poured a hazy hay color ale with a relatively large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of hay notes with some light citrus notes with some rustic malt notes. Taste is a mix of hay flavours with some citrus notes and some rustic malt notes with light spicy yeast notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Interesting take on the style but citrus notes are slightly too pronounced.  ,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.6
97183,katan,2013-07-28,"   500ml into a pint. Surprised there hasn't been a review of this yet A - Pours a fairly thick golden to golden brown color. Light head formation, off white. Little lacing. S - Primarily citrus on the nose, with a backdrop of some spiciness. Coriander comes to mind most, perhaps a little white pepper. T - Starts off lightly sweet, comes through with a clean two row maltiness. Mid-stream brings in the spiciness in the lead, coriander and some clove. Citrus is present, but in the background. Finishes with a yeast based fruitiness. M - A moderate body and a good amount of carbonation. Starts off sticky and then turns dry with the carbonation. Clean. O/D - A good and interesting saison. Not an extreme version of the style, i.e. more towards clean and quality flavors than the funkiness of a saison. A little bit filling, abv is reasonable.  ",3.75,4,3.75,3.5,4,3.84

79167,BeerNinja007,2013-03-07,"   Purchased this 22oz bomber for $7.99 at Koozie's (formerly Smiley's) of Dover NH. No code. Served cold in a tulip. A: 3/4"" of frothy white head settles to dense bubbles, leaving a thick foamy meniscus and some dense whispy stuff crowding the middle. Brew is semi-hazy, orange/ light copper in color, a bit dark for the style. On the second pour (after a bit of warming), it generates a generous head with stronger retention, pretty nice, but still not up to par with a decent saison. S: A nice dose of yeast and light malt sweetness hits my nose before I'm done pouring. Closer inspection reveals a soft, smooth, creamy, sweet malty yeasty aroma. Its missing some of the bright , crisp, saline, belgian spice stuff typical for a saison. Smells plenty tasty, just not very typical for the style in my opinion. Mild hop character is of mixed florals and some very soft tropical/ citrus fruits. Tiny notes of vanilla and butter, a hint of cocoa powder even. Light caramel. T: Fairly thick malt flavors, almost like a lighter brown ale. Jeeeez, do they even know what a SAISON is?! Definitely NOT true to style. Gingerbread, brown sugar, tannins, soda cracker. Hints of cocoa. Slight diacetyl in the finish. Moderate lemongrass, herb, and generic bittering hop. After it airs and warms up a little bit, the heavier flavors seem to burn off a little. The hop bitterness develops and takes a more prominent role and the body feels a bit more crisp. making it maybe a tad bit more saison-y, but still not very close. M: Perhaps the only thing even remotely like a saison is the mouthfeel due to its robust carbonation. Other than that, still not dry or crisp (attenuated) enough, too sweet and thick for the style. The combo of high carbo and moderate brown body does not mix well. Finish is slightly sweet and oily, not crisp, clean, or dry. O: If I didn't know this was supposed to be a SAISON then I might actually like it. But the fact that this is so far outside of the supposed style has me really hung up and I don't know how to react. I opened the bottle expecting one thing and got something completely different. Listen... I really love a great saison, it's one of my favorite styles to sip, quaff, chug, and brew. So when this thing ends up in my glass and it's not what I was expecting, I had a pretty strong negative reaction. Now that I've had my chance to vent, I think I'm coming to terms with this beer for what it is. It's not much as a saison, but it's pretty good as a beer, so I'm going to split the difference and weigh both of those factors equally (rather than completely slam it for not being true to style.  ",3.75,3.25,3.5,2.75,3.5,3.38
79167,TheManiacalOne,2012-11-24,"   On-tap 11/16/2012 at Doherty’s East Ave Irish Pub in Pawtucket, RI, served in a US tumbler pint glass. A: The beer is a light brown color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. S: The aroma is faint but contains Belgian yeast, caramelized malts, some spice, some fruit and a faint touch of hops. T: The taste starts out bready with mild flavors of Belgian yeast and a hearty malt character. Then some mild sweetness comes in from flavors of caramel and spices. The hops presence is mild but complementary and brings some balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet. M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky. O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, this is a solid beer worth drinking for a while.  ",4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.58

S: Smooth, sweet pale malt and yeasty esters - vanilla, white cake definitely a bit of pineapple and marshmallow. T: Drier than the aroma - a little bit of sweetness from the esters, with a mild smoky, herbal note. M: Light-bodied with somewhat frothy carbonation. O: This was pleasant to drink. A bit mild, but the smoky herbal note (perhaps from the sage?) makes it a little interesting - reminds me of similar notes in some Fantome saisons.  ",3.5,4,4,4,4,3.97

Light pineapple and citrus to finish it off. Lingering grass, earth and black pepper in the aftertaste. M: Medium bodied, a touch drying and chalky.

Swarms of large carbonation bubbles lead to a large three finger head that is sea foam white and the same in appearance. Lace seems to be very sticky at this time. Smell is kind of lemony, with some bread or yeast and rye spice. Taste is bitter of a yellow grapefruit, some sweetness too. There is just a bit of rye spice to this but not at all in the front. Mouth is crisp and the carbonation is round to spritzy. Body is delicate and the finish is average and dry. Overall I am a little confused by this one. I couldn't get a lot of rye in the taste.

S: Smells of rye, toast, some peppery spice, grass and a bit of butter. T: Lots of caramel malt and butter mixed with just a bit of pine and citrus hops. Rye spice on the finish is overpowered by unpleasant diacetyl flavors. M: Medium bodied, but with a very ""round"" mouthfeel to it that is likely a byproduct of whatever is causing the diacetyl. Lower carbonation levels. Mild bitterness. O: Simply put, this is just not a very good beer: Very little rye or hop character with an overwhelming amount of off-flavors.  ",3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.73

Medium body with a rich, spicy flavor. Just the right amount of rye to give it that sharp grainy taste with a touch of perfume. Hops provide a fairly bitter backdrop. Like an IPA but restrained enough to make the hops a deep part of the flavor profile without stealing the show. Resiny taste along with the browned biscuits and spicy tang. Nice malty flavor provides good balance. Compares favorably with the tasty Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye, I think. From the 22 oz bottle.  ",4,3.5,4,4,4,3.88

S: I get some of those fruit and citrus hop notes, over ripe peach and mango. But then I get the grain bill notes. Sweet maltiness. T: I will start with this, I am sick and my taste buds are a little off. I do get some spicy notes on the tip of the tongue from the rye. You get those hops in the middle of the mouth. Nice balance of the spicy grains and the fruity hops. Also this is a very easy drinking beer. The lower ABV is nice. M: Medium bodied like most IPAs in recent memory. O: I like this one.

Somewhat coarse on the palate likely given the rye component, otherwise showing the same citrus and caramel of the aroma. Offers an odd floral component that seems to come and go. Still a bit too malty with respect to hop flavors and rather reminiscent of an English IPA. Decent and smooth feel yet without the texture I would expect from a Rye IPA. Easy drinking and unotrusive with a flash of orange citrus and a light to moderate bitterness on the finish.  ",4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.28

L- Thick soapy white colored head,with good retention and sticky lacing.After the head fades away,it leaves thick fluffy patching.Deep hazy straw / yellow colored body,with low clarity and only distorted light showing through the glass.Low amount of carbonation,and heavy amount of sediment. S- On the nose I get sweet orange juice,fresh peaches,papaya,mango,and pineapple fruit notes.Trace elements of bitter pine hops,and bright biscuit malts.This is a very hop forward beer,mostly consisting of tropical fruits. T- The palate follows the nose with orange juice,papaya,fresh peaches,mango,and pineapple from the beginning till the end.The palate finishes off with slight flavors of bitter pine that lingers with a sweet biscuit malt balance.This is one of those ""juice bomb"" IPA's I have been patiently waiting to try.It did not disappoint,at all. F- The mouth feel is medium heavy,with a very sticky,yet smooth and silky texture.Low amount of oxidation on the tongue.Smooth on the finish,with just a small hint of dryness. O- I really don't know where to start with this one.This IPA is mind blowing.It is super juicy on the nose and the palate,with a perfect balance of bitter pine.I just wish Tree House wasn't so far away,otherwise I would drink this beer all the time.Trying this makes me very excited, to try some of their other offerings.If you love a good New England IPA / juice bomb,try and get this beer by any means necessary.This beer is pretty much perfect.Actually,this is the best beer I've had since I started doing these reviews.Cheers to Tree House,and Cheers to the gentleman who I traded with to obtain it.I hope you enjoy the Wide Awake,as much as I enjoyed the Haze!!!  ",5,5,5,5,5,5

This is their standard Southern Wit aged in red Cab wine barrels. The aging def helps add a very nice tart and funky complex character. Dark straw color, tart smell, great taste. The wine character mellows out the Belgium yeast in a good way. Would definitely seek out again. TN Brew Works - Please bottle this stuff. A four pack would definitely sell for the same price as the standard 6 pack of Souther Wit.  ",,,,,,4.75

The smell was somewhat acrid and I wouldn't recommend inhaling deeply if you value your sinuses. The flavor confirmed my assessment of the smell and brought to mind the smell of opening the cupboard below the kitchen sink where the cleaning products are stored. It was gassy and its feel in the mouth was distinctly soapy, reminding me of having my mouth washed out with lifeboy for cussing when I was a kid. Others have compared this beer to Lysol. They were being kind in their assessment of smell, texture and taste. Hands down the worst beer I have ever had.

191226,woodychandler,2018-01-07,"   This one is a real curiosity for me. Note that it does not identify itself as anything other than a ""Blood Orange Belgian Style Ale"". It is not a form of IPA, nor does it say which Belgian style that it is adhering to. These are the sorts of thoughts that occur on New Beer Sunday (Week 672) as I continue my brewery horizontal with Shipyard B.C. From the bottle: ""Florida brewed""; ""Belgian style ale brewed with coriander, orange peel, and natural flavors added"". I knew that it was going to be another screwed-up screw-top cap but I hated to deprive myself of the opportunity to Pop! the cap. Once it had been prised off, I began a slow, gentle pour into the awaiting glass, followed by a vigorous in-glass swirl. This action produced two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was solid Gold (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity, like sunshine in my glass, causing The Gelt Gang to come running in from my living room for a taste. Nose was unquestionably orange, but with a peppery spiciness. I was put in mind of a childhood activity book that showed me how to make a pirate hat out of folded newspaper and an air freshener out of cloves & an orange. This beer's smell reminded me of that early version of potpourri. Sweet, citrusy, but with a spiciness. Mmm. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and I have been noticing this in all of their beers thus far. Is it something about the water that they are using at their brewery? The taste was kind of odd, like a cross between an orange lollipop and orange perfume. It was quite sweet and I was not getting the spiciness in the mouth the way that I had on the nose. Finish remained sweet and perfume-y & I just was not digging it. I liked the concept, but its execution was sub-par. YMMV.  ",4,3.75,3.25,3,3.5,3.44

191226,jjamadorphd,2017-08-06,"   Shipyard is just one of those brewers I keep on trying and after I have another different offering I then keep on asking myself, 'Why?'. This particular brew is neither bloody or orange to the eyes, it is however a very clear and lightly orange-tinged brew with no head at all. The smell unique to an extent - it reminded me of an orange soda but with a hoppy tingle to my nose. The feel was mostly crisp, lightly water, but was the sessionable kind of feel - easy to pound. What I was perplexed with mostly was the taste. There was some of that orange soda character to it, there was some malty background, and the hops were mixed in as well, all of it, making for a simply weird brew. Not a particularly bad beer, but not the best the offer by a long shot. Though I think I would enjoy these on a hot summer day rather than having some calming beers at night.  ",2.5,3,2.5,3.75,2.5,2.75

253926,biboergosum,2018-05-20,"   473ml can - nothing in the way of info on the label as to how the word 'Bourbon' got into this one's name. This beer pours a clear, medium magenta colour, with three chubby fingers of puffy, rocky, and mildly fizzy pink head, which leaves some decent layered alien script lace around the glass as it rather lazily subsides. It smells of juicy blackberries, some musky florals, grainy and bready caramel malt, ethereal generic woody notes, a hint of wan yeastiness, and very, very subtle earthy, leafy, and musty hop bitters. The taste is gritty and grainy cereal malt, some blackberry and raspberry fruitiness, vanilla extract, a still pretty ephemeral woodiness, faint estery yeast, and more well-understated leafy, musty, and floral green hoppiness. The carbonation is fairly active in its palate-pinging frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and mostly smooth, with just a hint of fruity tartness maybe not playing all that well with the proverbial neighbourhood kids here. It finishes off-dry, that floral berry essence predominating. Overall - yeah, if it didn't say 'Bourbon' on the label, I would not have even noticed the minuscule amount that is present in this offering. Add to that the meek 5.3% ABV, and things don't quite make sense, other than the heady dose of dark fruity character that saves this particular 'Wild Thing' in the end.  ",4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.77
47604,ikats,2011-11-09,"   Pours clear, light orange in color with a slightly off-white head. Very aromatic. Mostly citrus notes (grapefruit). Maybe some pine notes. Can't say that I smell any rye or malty notes in general. Taste is not particularly balanced. The malty base seems more pronounced than it would be in a regular IPA (not sure if that's effect of rye). Hops are very bitter from the moment they touch your mouth all through the aftertaste. There is a bit of dryness (although there is some sweetness on the lips as well from malts). It's about medium light body. Fairly drinkable. I am not sure if this beer will become my favorite (let's be honest, it is not anywhere close to the top of my list), but it is not regrettable. I'm enjoying tasting it at the moment.  ",3,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.17
47604,Satchboogie,2011-10-12,"   22oz bottle poured into a tall tulip glass (Thanks vitese). A: Pours copper, fairly clear, with nearly 3 fingers of a tight, off-white head. Good retention, leaves decent lacing. S: Soft floral and citrus hops, spicy rye, caramel, smells bready. Lots of hop flavor, but not overly aggressive like many. T: Big, but soft hop presence up front with lots of flowers and citrus. There's not really any bitterness or 'kick', nor is it overly orange or grapefruit. Big bread notes with plenty of rye and spiciness. A little caramel, though it cleans out in the finish. M: Medium to slightly light body, moderate to slightly high (perfect) carbonation. Fairly smooth, very nice crisp and clean finish. Fairly chewy. Finish is fairly dry with just a little bitterness. O: Normally I would be looking for a bigger bite from the hops (more bitterness, more aggressive). Thinking of this as a rye beer though, I really like it. Gentle and flavorful hop presence that is the perfect compliment to the rye spiciness and hearty malts. Just the right touch of caramel to add richness without taking away the dry, clean and crisp finish. Tasty and refreshing and absolutely no astringency or alcohol presence. A tough one to rate, probably not an A- strictly as an IPA, but overall, I enjoyed this as much as a any beer I've given an A-...  ",4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.18
47604,MrVonzipper,2011-09-20,"   Clear amber color with a frothy 2 finger slightly off white head. Excellent retention and lacing. Nose is not what I expected. Quite lacking especially in the hop department. Slight spicy leathery notes with a little pale malt. The flavor is a perfect representation of the name minus it saying IPA on the bottle. Again lacking a bit of a hop characteristic. But everything else is great. Nice spicy and earthy rye notes with mild fruit and a touch of citrus. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a mild zesty spiciness, crisp with medium carbonation. Overall it's a nice very drinkable beer. Lacking in hop notes and characteristics for an IPA, but good. They need bottle dates to determine if that's the reason for the lack of hops. I do recommend this for the nice rye spiciness and earthiness that is really nice.  ",4.5,3,4,4,4,3.79

47604,FosterJM,2011-09-12,"   808th Review on BA Draft to Pint 12oz @Concourse Bowling, Fullerton, CA App- A nice darker orange out of the tap. Had a pretty minimal one finger head. Didn’t cling or stick like I was hoping it would. I think glasses were still a bit too cold. When I had this one out of the bottle, it was a heck of a lot different. Smell- A very nice smelling IPA. A lot of Rye comes through at 1st and is backed by a little bit of an earthy hop note and even a soft malt on the back. Not overly assertive with its aromatics, but enough to now its a big Rye beer. Taste- This was one of the more Rye forward beers I have had, right up there with Hop Rod Rye. This was very balanced with a lot of Rye being intermixed with a juicy hop and a little touch of malt on the other side. Forms a nice triangle of flavors. A little dry but that’s okay. Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbonation. A bit dry on the finish. A nice mixture of the rye and citrus. Drink- I'm becoming a fan of the Rye beers and I didn’t appreciate this one when I 1st had it. This was a nice beer to hang with and not have to worry about too much ABV or too much boldness. Smooth, subtle and a good beer.  ",3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.12

A: pours a amber/gold brown with 3 fingers of pillowy white head, lots of lacing remains. S: smells of grassy hops and sweet malts, the rye smell reminds me of a pastrami sandwich sans pastrami T: very pleasant hoppy bitterness, muted by the malts, moderately sweet and caramelly, but the star is the rye taste adding a bitter breadiness to the flavor profile M: very smooth, malts and hops mellow each other with a perfect velvety coat on my palate O: a great brew, haven't had it on tap but plan to next time I'm in OC.  ",3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.82
47604,pmarlowe,2011-08-26,"   No bottle date. Tulip glass. Pours a deep clear golden color with a finger of head, tiny bubbles. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells mostly like rye bread with an undercurrent of tangerine, prominent caramel and sugary malt. Taste is kind of grainy/bready with maybe a little orange/tangerine citrus, and again a hefty dose of caramel malt, finishing moderately bitter. Medium bodied and medium-light carbonation. Overall, this was a little disappointing in its lack of any sort of hop character. It's all malt and rye. I'd pass on this again.  ",4,3.5,3,4,3,3.28
47604,kzoobrew,2011-08-23,"   Pours a clear, bright orange body. A four finger, eggshell colored head rests atop. The fluffy head works its way back slowly. Fairly solid sheet of lacing blankets the glass. This is a great looking beer, I am not saying it is perfect but they do not get much better. The nose displays an impressive amount of balance. Sweet citrusy hop aroma comes across first. There is a pleasant malt base sitting right behind. Spicy rye and warm breadiness pair well with the hops. There is not a great deal of crystal malt coming through in the nose, I appreciate that. Soft grassy hops linger in the back. I have sat on this bottle for a little bit, while it is certainly with in the appropriate time from for enjoying, I feel the hops may have died down slightly. The aroma is very pleasant none the less. The flavor is very similar to the characteristics picked up in the nose with one huge difference, the rye. The rye simply was a complimentary aroma but is a dominant flavor. I cannot recall a Rye IPA with this much rye presence. The citrus hop flavor is noted upfront along side the rye. The earthy spiciness of the rye works well in combination with the citrusy hops. The bitterness from the hops is hard to judge, the almost astringent quality of the rye can mask it a bit. On my palate I would say the bitterness is a bit lower allowing the rye to provide the bite. Behind the rye the bready malt flavor completes the flavor profile. This is not a terribly complex beer, with many flavor transitions, but the flavors work very well together. Medium bodied beer, the carbonation is slightly lower than what I would desire. The finish is a touch above dry. The mouthfeel is the low point for this beer. While not bad by any means, it just does not leave me as impressed as the other attributes. Rustic Rye is a heck of a beer. I am really digging the assertiveness of the rye. The flavor combination works very well. A very drinkable beer. Big thanks to FosterJM for the bottle.  ",4.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.98
47604,HopHead84,2011-08-22,"   8/21/2011 A: Dark gold with a big frothy white head and lots of lacing on the pint glass. S: Floral notes with orange, tangerine, and grapefruit. Malt is bready, with rye and caramel. T: Bread and caramel with a little rye. Notes of orange blend with tangerine, attempting to combat the malt. Alcohol is well hidden. Bitterness is at a moderate level. M: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall: A good IPA, though maltier than desirable.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5
47604,Vanlingleipa,2011-08-07,"   This is a nice, solid brew that I would hand to someone new to craft beer. Appearance: Orange-brown with a fair amount of white head that disappears after a few minutes. Aroma: Distinct, but not overwhelming scent of hops Taste: This is not an overwhelming beer - The rye complements the hops well - They are both present at first taste with the hops coming out stronger. The rye lasts longer, hanging on to the finish as the taste fades. There's almost a smoothness to this beer, which is unusual for a hopsy beverage. I'd bring this one to a house full of bud drinkers as an introduction to craft beer - it won't overwhelm anyone, but still has a distinctive taste, scent and body. As for myself, I prefer bolder flavors.  ",3.5,3,4,3.5,4,3.68
47604,Buttermaker,2011-08-06,"   I generally don't like the flavor of rye, but in beer I find it's a nice compliment to the hops. It works especially well in an IPA where rye's natural astringency can't overpower the beer. This one's got a rich nose that offers plenty of caramel malt and cascade hops. I can't smell the rye. I can definitely taste it though. It adds a little spice to an otherwise solid IPA. The Rye flavor melds nicely into the hops on the finish. Solid effort. Recommended music pairing: Stephen Malkmus - Pig Lib  ",4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.58
47604,Bendurgin,2011-08-01,   Thanks for this one from Randy. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a burnt orange color with a thing layer of foam. Big rye aroma with a little bit of fruity and piney hops rounding this one out. Hints of caramel linger. Bitter hops start to finish here with a pretty good rye flavor. Slight fruity notes in the flavor but this has a big bitter hop finish. Light body with somewhat sharp carbonation. Pretty enjoyable IPA here. I love rye so this one is right up my alley!  ,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.63
47604,DarthKostrizer,2011-07-17,   Look: Brownish orange with 1 inch head and great retention and some spotty lace also had some floaters Smell: Very strong wheat and rye notes with some citrus and pine Taste: Very light wheat and rye notes and piney hops are the big flavors. Citrus fruits as well are present. AS the beer warms the piney hops become a bit overpowering Mouthfeel: Light body high carbonation and a dry finish it leaves the palate really dry that you need to keep drinking this. Is it that bad??? Overall: I really enjoyed this beer and will consume several more in the coming months. The is a great summer beer especially on these hot california nights. Good flavor profile and just an overall good beer  ,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.98
47604,AgentZero,2011-07-14,"   A - Burnt umber color with an off-white head that had moderate retention and stick. S - Fairly mild. Not a particularly hoppy IPA, although granted it is a single as opposed to double. There's some citrus/grapefruit notes. Some caramelized rye on the backbone. It smells nice, but fairly innocuous. T - Easy drinking. Some more hops, mostly grapefruit in nature. The rye is nicely present, but not overpowering. Nothing in this beer is overpowering, just smooth, easy to drink. M - Moderate body and carbonation and finishes on the dry side. O - Not a bad beer, can get it down easily enough, but there isn't a ton special that is going on here.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.48
47604,Klym,2011-07-08,"   Poured into a stone nonic. A: Pours a difficult mix of brown, orange, red and yellow with different colors and shades all over the place depending on how the light hits. Lacing just covers the wall of the glass with foam. Nice. S: Tangerine, mango, apple, cherry, hops and yeast in the nose. The fruitiness and hoppiness really balance well in the nose, which I think is a nice change from the one-sided dominance of so many IPAs. T: Taste is more bitter than I expected. I got some yeasty floaties in my glass and I'm a little bit worried that's affecting the taste. Honestly, much more hop bite, grain and yeast in the taste than was present in the smell. Fruits are more subtle and swirl around the strong presence of the aforementioned flavors offering good support, but I wish the fruitiness was a little less shy. There's kind of a hollow taste gap in the middle which is strange to me. M: Watching the beer pour made it seem like it had an almost syrup like viscosity and you can appreciate the slick thickness in the mouth as well. Really a silky feeling though that does well by me. Carbonation is felt more in the rest in the mouth than in the tongue. O: I drank this on the recommendation of Cavery and he had a glass from this same bottle with me. He says there seems to be something strange about this bottle in relation to the last time he tried it so I leave my review here open to the possibility that the yeast I accidentally poured or some other bottle issue isn't giving me the full experience here. That said, the beer I just had is good, interesting, but seems to have a strong need to be tweaked. Flavor of fruits needs to be upped, hops/yeast toned down, and progression of the tastes needs to be reworked a bit. I think there are some raw materials of greatness in this beer but at the moment, only the raw materials.  ",4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.65
47604,OWSLEY069,2011-07-06,"   Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with a small white head. In the aroma, dry rye and a hint of hops. In the taste, a small hop and a small rye fruitiness. A small hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry green apple skin in the aftertaste. A nice rye presence, but small hop than expected.  ",4,3.5,4,4,4,3.88

291936,FLima,2017-07-16,"   Amber color with a thick off-white head with good retention and leaving laces. Malty aroma with notes of caramel and mild grapefruit citrusy. Dry hop is hidden in its malty base. Flavor with notes of grapefruit, pine, toasted and caramel malts, spices and pineapple core. Dry and bitter aftertaste. 53 IBUs sounds right. Medium body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 7,5% is hidden in its malty base. Traditional American IPA still with a mild British accent probably given its malty base and focus on grapefruit. Interesting pricing.  ",,,,,,3.12
265102,StonedTrippin,2018-09-02,"   calling this a blonde ale is a stretch, or at least it sets up some misleading expectations, this is hazy and pretty orange colored, some sediment in it, not what i was expecting from the style, but a beer my gal and i enjoyed quite well last night. it has a citrus fruitiness to it, a fuller malt body, some starchiness, a floral aspect, and a yeast strain with really interesting flavor, estery, not the conventional profile for a blonde ale, thats for sure. orange peel, under ripe strawberry, light honey, and just a dash of hop bitterness. this would be heavy to me without such high carbonation, which kind of saves it for me in terms of texture. nowhere near as light as i would like in a blonde ale, but when i accept it as something else, unique to itself, then i like it more. good for the early fall, a little more substantial and with some unique flavors happening, fruity and interesting, even if it is a little amateurish. overall a fun glass of beer for a little something different, but dont come in expecting the standard blonde ale.  ",3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.63

178983,Harrison8,2018-06-23,"   Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Aroma boasts notes of light coffee, with heavier notes of toasted and nutted malts. Despite a dark aroma, it doesn't come across as strong, or like something that would take willpower to consume. Flavor profile is the same toasted and nutted malts, with coffee appearing a bit stronger. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy, with a medium thickness. Overall, a very smooth stout with pleasant notes of coffee. Coffee doesn't dominate this beer, allowing the oatmeal stout to resonate well. Draft. Reviewed from notes.  ",4,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.13

178983,StonedTrippin,2017-04-29,"   aside from its overall quality, nothing about this beer is particularly striking on its own. the coffee is bold in here, fresh and yummy, but not overly unique or anything. meanwhile, the malt bill is about right for a good stout of this stature, but there is nothing about it that is really distinguishing. the yeast is almost irrelevant here, and there isnt any weird adjunct beyond the coffee to make the freaks freak out. its almost understated from top to bottom, no frills at all, and just a very well made stout with coffee, with a rich starchy oaty body, some slight residual sweetness, and a wonderful creamy texture that opposes the coffee sharpness at the right instances without ever shucking the mellow jive here. more coffee would be cool for the flavor, but its neat how low acid it is, and how the beer seems light but the roast seems heavy. drinkable for what it is, but somewhat linear on the whole. i liked this apparently more than others, and im not sure why. something about this is honest and endearing, and i feel like i owe it respect...  ",4,4,4,4,4.25,4.05

178983,breadwinner,2015-12-21,"   Starts out well enough, a nice rocky tan head atop and a nose of, well, coffee. Probably not the best coffee nose ever, but not particularly stale or acrid or any of the other adjectives that come to mind in a bad coffee stout. On the palate, though, this one falls off a little. I sometimes think folks demand too much body from stouts, but this one -- particularly at almost 7% ABV -- is indeed lacking, and it serves to amplify a sort of coffee-water vibe. It's straight ahead, one note, roast and a pot o' coffee stuff. Overall, it ain't bad. It'll scratch your coffee-laced beer itch, but this is more diner-level than your favorite local roastery.  ",4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.65

47604,Cavery,2011-07-01,"   Bottle shared with SundaySour, poured into Stone Nonic glass. poured carefully, leaving yeast at the bottom of the bottle. A: Early morning red sunlight with a massive 3 finger head. The head fluffs over the body like some fancy soap in a scented bathtub. If Sundaysour pays too much attention to this visual, she'll remind me that I'm not romantic enough. An unusual redness, but what a strong head! S: Smells of fresh cut leather, tropical fruits, and persimmons. Really nice enticing nose. Sweet bread malt backbone accentuates tropical fruits in favor of mango, and gradually pulls the senses away from citrus. A bit conflicted, but good nonetheless. T: Very light tangerine citrus zing, mango middle, and french bread crust malt. Pleasantly light grainy bittering that is chased by a lemongrass note. A seed-like linger in favor of sesame makes for a fantastic aftertaste. An extremely crushable Rye IPA. Finish of lighter rustic breads. M: Modest carbonation that disguises a medium/heavy body for the style. This really adds to the bready dimension of the malt. I feel like I have a crunchy artisanal bread in my mouth. Quite nice and distinct, but may contribute to the flavor being a bit monotone. O: This beer is on the verge of greatness, but for right now it can settle solidly on the side of very-goodness. I think with a bit of refining this could give the Alpine IPAs a run for their money. This beer certainly has some ""rough"" edges, but they aren't necessarily negative. There is a really ""raw"" ingredient element to this beer that I appreciate, but I would urge bootleggers to dig deeper. They have something really good here that could be great. It could use maybe a bit stronger flavor (imperial anyone?) and perhaps some more discernable flavor transitions. However, this beer is aptly named. In the end this is a deliciously ""rustic"" rye offering.  ",4.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.06
47604,Urbancaver,2011-06-14,   Pours a hazy orwngish brown. A nice amount of light tan head. Very frothy and nice. Smells sweet with a touch of rye spice. Some pine on the nose as well.

47604,Arbitrator,2011-05-21,"   Chilled bottle into a glass. A: Pours a hazy chestnut-amber body with a short-lived off-white head. Lacing is light and the primary remnant of head is a medium collar on the beer. S: Vibrant citrus and floral hops that combine to remind me of overripe mango. It's vaguely earthy, as well. No rye in the nose that I can pick up, but there is a cereal note. Not all that pungent, definitely not a standout. T: Rye is a little more pronounced in the taste, though it's not spicy; it contributes a robust graininess that counteracts the [dominant] earthy hops. Mild taste of citrus, but nothing as vibrant as the nose suggested. Also a little buttery (??!?) by the end -- I haven't tasted this in an IPA in a long time. M: Medium-bodied, with good carbonation. Fairly smooth despite the rye, which I usually expect to contribute a bite. O: It's drinkable, but forgettable. Still not feeling the Bootlegger's love yet...  ",2.5,2.5,2,4,2,2.35
47604,wino47,2011-05-06,   Hazy appearance with nice carbonation and a pleasant aroma of citrus and bready notes. The body is a little light with the flavor coming across a little on the watery side.

47604,Retsinis,2011-05-05,"   Poured from a 22oz bomber bottle into a Bruery tulip glass. A: The beer pours a cloudy golden orange, with a light brown tinge hue. A solid inch head rose, leaving some spotty lacing. S: Scents of grapefruit, and mild caramel, some dry lemon, citrus, very mild rye, and hop spice. T: Mixture of tropical hops, followed by carmel sweetness, with a bitter dry finish. It's a bit between a light Imperial IPA with this malt character, and a lighter hops than an IPA. The Rye notes could be stepped up too imho. M: medium mouth, dry finish. Malt smooths it out a bit, but it also has some grit to it. O: Decent, but not stellar. It has potential, so some recipe tweaking and it could be a real winner.  ",3.5,3,3.5,3,3,3.23
47604,largadeer,2011-04-24,"   Bottle from K&L RWC. No freshness date. The color is a brownish-gold, fairly hazy with a lower-moderate level of carbonation that produces about an inch of head. The nose is...pretty bland, actually. I was expecting a lot more from this, having had some great IPAs from Bootleggers. There's a citrusy, grapefruit-like hop presence, but it's mild. I can't say that I get much rye. A bit of cereal sweetness. Not a bad aroma by any means, just boring. There's a bolder hop character on the palate, leaning in the grapefruit direction with a little bit of an herbal/earthy twang. Rye has a moderate presence, lending some drying earthiness to an otherwise bready, moderately sweet malt base. As I work my way through the bottle, I start to pick up mild diacetyl. The finish is pretty grainy and bitter; the beer feels a bit thin until it warms up, and then the caramel malt backbone becomes more evident. Overall, there's nothing horribly wrong with this beer, it's just very run-of-the-mill. Easy enough to drink, but completely forgettable. It's probably more of a B- than C+, but I can't justify bumping up my scores any more than this. Pass on this one and give their SoCo IPA a try.  ",3.5,3,3.5,3,3,3.23

47604,DoktorZee,2011-04-14,"   Poured from a 22oz bottle without a best before date into a schooner. A – Solid amber color and very slightly cloudy, fluffy white head that resolved after a couple minutes leaving a moderate amount of lacing. S – Strong citrus hops on the nose; really nice and cutting. So strong that I couldn’t get anything else. T – Best way I could think of to describe the taste as remarkably even and bitter. The citrus hops was present from the first part of the sip and all the way through. It was supported by some very mild bready malts, but the hops were absolutely center stage. M – This had a lighter body than its color and pedigree would have suggested. It was only mildly carbonated with no booziness. D – Very drinkable, but also a bit unidimensional; lacked character beyond the hops to really drive me to drink more than one. A decent IPA but not really remarkable in any dimension other than the solidity of its hops!  ",4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.65

Finish is a mix of chewy grains and light hop bitterness. Not too bad, just nothing mind blowing. M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Overall chewy feel with most of it lingering throughout the finish. D - Decent stuff.

47604,Wowcoolman,2011-03-05,"   Rye IPA hopped with Citra, poured into a Tremens glass. The nose is pleasant; sweet and malty. The taste is hops and rye, but the combination doesn't quite come together creating a weird mix of flavors with the rye somewhat holding things together. A subtle honey sweetness comes at the finish. Interesting, but not on the level of Hop Rod or Lenny's RIPA.  ",4,4,3.5,3,3,3.5
47604,jpmclaug,2011-02-13,"   Bottle into a pint glass. Got this on my birthday trip to SoCal at the brewery. A - amber body with a white head on top S - Light floral hop aroma mingles with some pale malts T - Spicy notes from the rye, a bit of a florally hop flavor, really well balanced, finishes with a hint of bitterness M - medium body, good amount of carbonation D - Drinks real easy. Almost like a APA rather than an IPA. This is a really enjoyable beer but nothing otherworldly. I'm glad I got to try it and would drink it again.  ",4,4,4,4,4.5,4.1
47604,PeprSprYoFace,2011-01-19,   Been seeing this beer on shelves for a while now but never bought one. Now that I tried their Knuckle Sndwitch I've been trying more Bootleggars stuff. Pours a very nice orangy hazy yellow color. Very nice frothy head with very nice lacing. In the Aroma you really get the rye. Nice hoppy citrucy aroma complements the rye character. The flavor is great. Nice hoppy bite with the smoothness of the rye. It feels like it's missing something in the finish. Like a hop isn't biting my tongue enough. It hits the sides of your tongue but notthe center. Mouthfeel is good. Nice dryness with a good carb. Overall I could drink this often. If I see it on tap somewhere I'll get it for sure. It's a solid beer and I don't know why it only had a B rating on here. It's not the best ive had but it is solid.  ,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.15
47604,mothman,2011-01-16,"   Pours 1/4 finger of beige head. Color is a burnt rustic orange. Aroma: Rye, grassy/floral hops. Some grapefruit citrus and bready maltys. Taste: Grapefruit citrus, floral grassy hops, rye, bready malts. Simple. Mouthfeel: Bitter and spiced. Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends really, really dry. Overall, decent rpa, but a bit to dry for me. Somewhat drinkable.  ",3,3,3,3,3,3
47604,tburus,2011-01-14,"   Poured into a Duvel tulip. Appearance: A cloudy, light brown liquid with a nice, thick, two-finger, off-white head. Smell: Bright citrus hop aroma with a mellow rye sourness to it. Very relaxing fragrance. Taste: The initial hit is of hops, but quickly the sour rye flavor takes over. Going down the hops reappear in a tame bitterness. Mouthfeel: Definite IPA bitter mouthfeel. Not too bitter. Like most other aspects of this brew, it appears that the rye component is muting the more traditional IPA aspects. To be honest, I don't totally mind this, as I tend to enjoy rye beers and have yet to develop a great affinity for the more highly touted ""hopped up"" IPA's. Drinkability: Super easy drinkability. The muted hop character and low ABV make this a very appealing option. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this beer and am thankful to nicks6217 for throwing this in on a trade that we completed.  ",3.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.07

A little caramel with a smidge of vomit on the end...The taste and feel are really light. Feel is annoyingly thin. The taste is light rye, not strong but incredibly easy to drink, a total palate cleanser.  ",4,3.5,4,2.5,5,3.93
47604,thagr81us,2011-01-10,"   Served from tap into a sampler mason jar at the brewery. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. It maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat (rye perhaps?), and citrus hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus hop, and slight bitter hop. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this wasn't bad, but this was not great. It was nicely balanced in flavor, but it just seemed to be lacking something... The rye/wheat taste perhaps??? It had a pretty good aroma though. Would definitely be happy to try this one again.  ",4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.75

Aroma is candied pineapple along with indistinct tropical and stone fruits, very appealing. Taste has the same candied pineapple as the aroma but adds some distinct mango, nectarine, and white grape notes with a lightly sweet finish. Medium+ body and low-moderate carbonation.

APPEARANCE: pours a clear, golden color with one finger white head with excellent retention, it slowly dissipated until a thin unbroken layer of bubbles remained, there is significant lacing on the glass and higher than average carbonation. SMELL: cracker and sweet malt. TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet then the taste of crackers and finishes with a gentle hop kiss. PALATE: medium body and higher than average carbonation. OVERALL: this is a terrific pils because it is so wonderfully balanced, it would appeal to anyone who likes beer, this is the third beer I have had from this brewer and they were all wonderful, I would definitely buy this again and will be trying more from this brewer in the near future.  ",4.5,4,4,4,4.25,4.08

The review I’m leaving here is for the “Pilsner” from 2015, which tastes more German than Czech. My original review was: The German Pilsner pours a nice clear golden color. Decent lacing, with German hop and pils malt nose. Very clean, solid example of a European pilsner. Will keep on hand all summer.  ",4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.77

Can chilled down to 36 dgrees F in my beer cooler and poured in to a handled glass thumb-print stein. Pours a clear straw-yellow in color with a good 1-finger fizzy white head that settles down to mostly along the sides of the glass. A decent amount of lacing is seen with each sip that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of grains mostly. Pretty much the same for the taste with lots of grain aftertaste as well, but not hoppy. Lighter to medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation as seen with lots of bubbles rising up from the sides and bottom of the glass. Overall, it was a decent example of this brew style.  ",,,,,,3.75

47604,Anaz,2010-12-25,"   A- Hazy red orange, 2 fingers of white head with little lacing. S- Orange flower water and meyer zest with rye spiciness, and some herbal hop character. T- Very malty, a little sweet. Kind of like a rye bread with candied citrus zest. Not bad, but balanced in favor of the malt rather than being hop forward. Floral and herbaceous hop flavors marry well with the rye spice, and the lingering malt sweetness results in an almost neutral finish after being tempered by the hop bitterness, which makes this very easy to drink. The mouthfeel is very full, and a little syrupy and oily, but it's not cloying. The carbonation is low. This is a very drinkable rye IPA with good flavor, but not a lot of intensity. I'd really like it if it was a little drier, but, it's still a good beer and a good reason to support a local brewery.  ",4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.78
47604,AWolfAtTheDoor,2010-12-19,"   This is my first beer from Bootlegger's. Pours a hazy dark golden color. Lacing is pretty looking good so far. First smell was a blast of apple/cider. Upon stronger whiffs, I think it's the rye and/or yeast character playing tricks with me. Very different smelling than other rye beers I have had. Was not expecting this taste at all. I can only describe it as a creamy rye, with a hint of hop bitterness at the end. But this beer is all biscuit malt and rye. Medium mouthfeel. Slightly syrupy even. This is a nicely bodied beer. Very drinkable. It's smooth and tasty. Rye is one of my favorite ingredients. If I were grading this beer according to style, it would fall flat on it's face. Not even close to an IPA. However if you like rye, give it a shot.  ",4,3.5,4,4,4,3.88
47604,Xul,2010-12-05,"   A: Pours a translucent golden with some amber highlights, capped by two fingers of foamy, off-white head. Retention is moderate as it slowly settles to about a half finger of head. S: Moderate citrus up front along with piney and earthiness, followed by pleasant spicy notes of rye. Toffee base is evident in the background, although aroma as a whole is a bit subdued. T: Hops are a bit muted up front with piney and earthy notes coming through. Rye comes through strong on the mid-palate before giving way to a burst of sweet caramel near the back end. M: Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation, feels a bit thin. D: Easily drinkable but doesn't quite live up to its potential. I'll certainly try it again as the beer has its merits, perhaps this had sat a bit too long.  ",4,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.43
47604,kk73,2010-11-09,"   Poured from a 22oz. bottle into my glass. A - Pours a clear brunt orange with a modest white head that quickly disappeared into a white sheen and a white ring around my glass. Leaves a little lacing. S - Not getting much in the way of spicy rye(maybe I dont know what rye is supposed to smell like). Some faint floral hops combined with a slighty sweet malt backbone. T - Not much on the tongue either. A slight grapefruit bitterness that does not last long followed by some sweetness possibly from the malt. M - Light and crisp, maybe a touch watery. D - Not a bad beer, just not one I would purchase again. However this could be sessionable on a very hot and humid day. Very light and refreshing and very little alcohol detection.  ",4,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.21
47604,Beerandraiderfan,2010-11-06,"   Picked this up while in Socal for BT (what a magical 48 hours), couldn't beat the price on this. Drank at the Utah State @ Nevada tailgate. Pours a light orange, very clear, good carbonation and average head, light hop aroma, sweetness, tempered. Taste, relatively smooth, lacking the rye spiciness you might expect, but decent hopping, light caramel flavor, still carries some of that sweetness throughout. Not a complex or strong rye beer at all. $3.49 a bomber, it was worth that.  ",4,3.25,3.5,3,3.5,3.42
47604,klikger,2010-11-03,"   Bomber served in a Goose Island IPA tulip A - Medium to dark amber, large white head (shrinks down after a minute or two), and great lacing S - Floral hops, rye, and oranges T - Rye and lemony hops --&gt; bready rye and a little black pepper --&gt; a splash of grapefruit briefly finishes off this rye cocktail M - Medium-bodied and adequately carbonated. D - Inoffensive and pretty tasty. Not bad. This is a solid rye IPA - it's not too complex, but the tastes it possesses are pulled off nicely. Definitely worth a try if you like the style.  ",4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.73
47604,Gobzilla,2010-10-26,"   Poured a orangish brown with a half finger of head and left some bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. On the first whiff I was greeted by some citrusy qualities but had caramel malt presence with bready biscuit notes and faint hops in the background. The hops were a tad more potent on the palate with citrus and slight pine accents with lots of sweet caramel notes but no rye to be found. The brew was light to medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, citrusy, malty, and slight hoppy finish. It drank really good and would probably be able to drink lots of this beer in one sitting making it a pretty sessionable brew.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.73
47604,koopa,2010-10-25,   22oz bomber received as an extra in a trade with a generous BA thanks! Appearance: Pours copper with honey folds. The crown is a 1 finger soapy white that displays moderate retention and lace. Smell: Rye and floral hops over a slightly toffee like malt. Taste: Same as the nose but more pungent. I'd give it a 3.8 if I could so I'm rounding up a bit. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with active fine carbonation. Drinkability: Sessionable.  ,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.03
47604,ZX6Chris,2010-08-30,"   A-Golden amber. Nice tight white head that settles on top. Slight lacing that settles quickly back into the glass. S-At first it smelled like a Jr. Pliny, but the aroma faded quickly. Now I'm getting a little wet cardboard. Definitely not good. T-Earthy, spicy hops, spicy and mildly sweet malts and there it is again, wet cardboard. M-like the head suggests this is a creamy beer, light, maybe a little undercarbed for the style. D-It was going well at first but that wet cardboard taste ruined it. I drank enough to finish my review and then I drain poured.  ",4.5,2,2,2.5,2,2.2
47604,emmasdad,2010-08-22,"   Picked this one up at Holiday Wine Cellar on a recent trip to San Diego. Poured from the bomber a medium orange color with a huge rocky white head.

Not bad, but kind of a disappointment considering the number of great west coast IPAs out there.  ",3,3,3,3.5,3,3.05
123949,NikyP,2014-08-20,"   Had a pint of this on tap at the Magnolia Hotel in downtown Omaha. Brewery is just down the street. This one doesn't disappoint. Truly a pilsner. Extremely drinkable (or it could be effects of the long day's travels). I really like this beer. Clean, fresh tasting, a nice golden grain flavor on the aftertaste. Some decent lacing for a pilsner. Fairly light on carbonation. Clear gold color. Aroma is very faint, almost unnoticeable. Almost all the taste on this one is post-swallow. I think I'll have another.  ",,,,,,4.5

47604,Augustiner719,2010-07-17,"   Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass. Got this as an extra, cant remember who but thank you very much if you read this. Pours a beautiful red brown color with hop haze and a massive, massive head. almost thought it was infected at how much head there was and the retention lasts forever. Smells bready with just a slight spicy note from the rye. has a touch of lemony hops as well. Tastes a touch sweet, but has a good hop bite to it. sorta has that hombrewed sweetness to it. Love the light body with caramel malts. I would have thought it was an amber ale to be honest with some hops added. Nothing crazy for the style but the key here is that its balanced well. Mouthfeel is decent with that medium carbonation retaining in the actual liquid after the massive head recedes. This is a very drinkable beer, just nothing to go running for. not sure of the price but if its a qpr then maybe its worth a shot to seek out. nice job though.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.48
47604,SpdKilz,2010-04-25,"   Appearance - Pours into my SA Perfect Pint with a dark amber hue. Over two fingers of tan, fluffy head is achieved with a moderate pour. The head is slowly dissipating, leaving decent lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell - Slight hops, floral, citrus [i.e. grapefruit], and sweet maltiness. Honestly, it also smells quite literally just like marijuana (after a few big intakes of the nose, one can most definitely smell the ""dankness"" to this drink). Taste - Flavor smells similar to the nose but overall muted. It is a bit sweeter than most other IPAs but not in a way that detracts from the overall drink. Not much rye can be found after numerous sips. There is plenty of grapefruit, sweet malts, and pine. Not horrible by any means but just nothing that really jumps out at you. Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, decent carbonation. Drinkability - Pretty quaffable. This is by no means a bad IPA, however, as someone else stated previously, for the price there is no reason to buy it. For the same price I could have opted to get a Blind Pig which was right next to this (but I wanted to try something new). Again, I'm glad I tried it but with so many other great West Coast D/IPA's out there, I won't be getting this again.  ",4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.78
47604,RoyalT,2010-04-03,"   Appearance - This is a thick, murky light brown in color with a faint orangish tint and a brown-white head that was almost as thick as the beer itself. Smell - There's a lot going on in here. The hops jump out first. They are mainly citrus in character but with a very bitter slant. They are incredibly creamy on the nose if that's possible and there's a sharpness to them that you don't often find. The malt base is rank in a very good way. The rye comes out husky and quite tight to the smell. Beneath it all is a rich sweetness that again smells very tight. All of this malty goodness play especially well with the hops. Taste - The hops and malts play nice at the taste, too. The hops lose some of their sharpness that I got from the nose but are still large. The malts are just wonderful though and especially that sweet character came threw beautifully at the taste. It is all just the right mix of citrus hops, malts, light non-grainy rye, and sugar. Mouthfeel - This is huge in the mouth. I wouldn't call it full-bodied but definitely medium on the big side. The carbonation is light and appropriate. There is some light bitterness throughout but this is not a bone-crushing bitter drink like some IPAs. Drinkability - With a modest 6.2% ABV this is definitely a session ale. It is very smooth yet big and chewy and has enough complexity to keep things entertaining. I definitely enjoyed this better than most as it is only averaging an overall score of 3.5 or so and I thought it was way above that grade. Big, heavy, and harmonious.  ",4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.47
47604,chickencoop,2010-03-18,"   Picked this up at Whole Foods/ i left my wallet in El Segundo, pretty solid beer selection with a nice emphasis on locals. The pour on this was a big hazy orange, almost Widmer Heffe like, which is strange since some of the previous reviews had it translucent and almost clear. I liked to citrusy smell, which balances with the malty taste, almost to a creamy feel. This was quite drinkable, my only concern is that these guys are inconsistant with what hit's the market and how each bottle or batch is different. I got a good one, i'll be back. Just an update, I can't stop buying this stuff.  ",4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.15
47604,shivtim,2010-02-15,"   Thanks for the bottle, Konrad! I like the color scheme on the bottle; it fits the name. Poured it out into a pint glass. It's surprisingly translucent, with not the tiniest hint of haze. Small streams of bubbles. Looks like tea water; a simple golden yellow with slight red tinges, and a tiny ring of white head on top. Nose has a sharp sweet fruit smell, like apple and pear. This layer is almost like a cider. Some hops come through as well, but it's dominated by the sugary fruit. Taste is sweet malty flavors, vaguely pineapple. Lingering hops come in at the end to remind that it's an IPA, but they are very gentle. I can't pick up on the rye. Very gentle mustiness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both average. Overall not bad, just doesn't seem to fit the rye or IPA categories.  ",3,3.5,3,3,3,3.12
47604,coldmeat23,2010-02-09,"   GLASS: Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass TEMP: Cellared @ approx 55 degrees Thanks to RodBurg for the Bootlegger's Brewery hook-up! This is a lightly hazy, golden brown colored liquid, with a slight orange cast to it. A one-finger, off-white colored, head of foam sits on top. Retention is fairly good, but is gone before the glass hits the halfway point. Lacing is good in appearance, but is very slippery. Lots of citrus hops notes, blended with a boatload of caramel presence. Almost has a butterscotch(?!) quality to it. Light spice notes and a biscuity yeast presence. The sweetness of butterscotch/caramel hits first and lingers for awhile. Just when you think that nothing is going to happen, in comes a good kiss of citrus hops, bringing a touch of bitterness with it. The yeast is still present, but it's somewhat buried. There is a nice hint of rye spice coming through, but not nearly as much as I had anticipated/expected. The body is medium at best, but I'd probably put it in the high end of light bodied. The carbonation is medium level. It has a crisp sharpness to it. The body is a letdown, to me. It's quite drinkable, but it's really just kind of a lackluster beer. I hate saying that, because I really hoped to like it. If I want something completely inoffensive that I don't have to think about the multiple layers of, this would be on the list, sadly.  ",3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.33
47604,snpub540,2010-01-29,"   Poured a clear light copper hue with an eggshell colored head. Left little lacing on the glass during the drink however. Smell was a faint floral hoppiness with some sweet malty notes as well. Not much going on there. Taste was a balanced between the malts and the hops. Upfront some caramel malt and a slight rye spice flavor. Hops were crisp and refreshing in the finish. Floral hops were the majority, with a slight grassiness. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and made for a refreshing thirst quencher. Drinkability was good because of the balance. Not too much hop bite, but not to much malt sweetness. Alcohol flavor is subdued, and this probably could be a session beer.  ",3.5,3,3.5,4,4,3.53

47604,dardan,2010-01-22,"   Perfectly respectable IPA, though the Rye aspect is not as pronounced as some of the competition. A: Clear golden, good foam & lacing, sediment remained in bottle, S: Hops with a little malt, appropriate for an IPA, T: Hoppy but little rye character, a good example of an IPA, M: Clean and crisp, appropriately West Coast IPA, D: Easy to drink, slight alcohol in back may slow down some. Not the greatest Rye IPA on the market, but good, clean taste, aroma, and IPA character make it well worth trying.  ",4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.71
47604,womencantsail,2010-01-19,"   On-tap at Bootlegger's A: The pour is an orangish-yellow color with a nice white head on top, which sticks around for quite awhile. S: The smell is primarily citrus hops (grapefruit) with a touch of caramel but no rye notes to speak of. T: The taste is a bit better than the nose. The grapefruit hops are there along with a somewhat mild bitterness. The caramel malt provides a bit more sweetness than I'm used to in an IPA, but not bad. Again, no rye to be found. M: Medium in body with moderate carbonation. D: This IPA isn't too bad, but not necessarily one of the better west coast incarnations. The name is also a bit misleading as I really failed to detect any of the usual rye characteristics.  ",4,3,3.5,4,4,3.56
47604,augustgarage,2010-01-08,"   Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. ""Rustic"" suggests that the brewer lacks confidence in this beer - the dent in the bottle-cap (were these hand-capped?) further adds to the ""homebrew"" feel. Safety orange liquid with some chill haze - topped by a billowing finger of off-white foam. Excellent lacing and decent retention. Caramel, citrus, and rye flour aromas - floral and earthy but somewhat subdued. Bitterness is assertive, though the hop flavors are not particularly complex. Tangerine, grass flowers, and floral/herbal notes combine with honey or caramel malt. The rye adds a touch of sourness in the finish almost like buckwheat. Spritzy carbonation, not quite medium-bodied, and very ""zippy"" mouthfeel. A good effort which I would be happy to have again - though not in the same league as Alpine Nelson.  ",4,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.68
47604,DogFood11,2009-12-21,"   22oz brown bottle. I'm a sucker for Rye Ipa's dating back to the grand daddy of them all Bear Republics Hop rod rye. Poured into a small tulip it is an inviting dark copper color with a frothy, meaty off white head. The nuts and bolts of this brew come up short. Its lacking any depth and is kind of thin for this style. Rye stands out boldly and in this its moderate to mild. Mouthfeel is also light with some lingering some distracting sticky malt. Notes: Not for me. A great style. I'm glad more brewery's are attempting the RYE IPA but this needs some work.  ",4,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.39
47604,GRG1313,2009-11-26,"   Pours a clear dark orange amber with a beautiful thick and firm white head. Nose is medium sweet and floral grapefruit with a hint and undertone of ripe pineapple. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy and with a very nice body. Flavors are actually very much like a rye bread in nature-rye grain flavor with extremely well balanced malt and fruit. Finish is long and with a bitter rye grapefruit character. Very consumer friendly and food friendly with a very nice character, flavor profile and finish. Finish goes on forever and gets more and more bitter for a minute or two.  ",4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.41
47604,Overlord,2009-10-10,"   Pours a golden, orange-ish yellow with a big white foam head. Smells ... where's the rye? Smells like some tropical IPA notes, just a hint, and ... maybe some grapefruit. Kind of muted. Flavor is similarly uninspiring. It's sweeter than a normal IPA, but I don't know if that's from the Rye, or what, because I detect basically no Rye. Some grapefruit, some sweet malt, but a bit grainy. Well ... it's not bad, but too expensive for what it is.  ",3.5,3,3,3.5,3,3.08
47604,mentor,2009-10-04,"   Pours a 3 finger nearly white head over a mildly cloudy copper liquid. Smells piney and tropical hop aroma with some musty rye character. Tastes juicy tropical flavors from hops with sweet malt undertones and an earthy sting/edge from the rye. Hop flavor is mostly lemon and blood orange with some pineapple and pine. Comes across a bit acidic and is accompanied by a mild alcohol sting (quite clean). Esters are minimal and hop bitter is strong and clean. The hop bitter blends with the alcohol and acidic well, but the hop flavors are too over the top. The finish falls flat with a lack of flavors. Would be nice to have a grassy hop bitterness to keep the palatte engaged. Md-light body with some dextrinous character. Strong carbonation is detracting. Decent beer.  ",3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.25
47604,glid02,2009-09-04,"   On-tap at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach, CA. Pours a nice copper color with a one-finger off-white head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving solid lacing. Smells of pale malts with good amounts of citrus hops and light hints of spicy rye. Tastes very similar to how it smells. Pale malt flavors up front with hints of rye are joined shortly by light citrus flavors. Midway through the sip the rye gains a bit of strength before fading to a mildly bitter ending. Mouthfeel is good. It has a nice thickness with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good. I finished my glass fairly quickly and could have another. Overall this is a solid Rye IPA that I could session and enjoy it. Worth a shot.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4
47604,PizzaQueen1,2009-06-28,"   I think Bootlegger's has done a great job with making an IPA that everyone can enjoy. So many beer drinkers that are stepping out for the first time are afraid of IPA's because they are over-the-top in flavor. The color is a cloudy/light carmel hue. It pours beautifully from a tap, leaving a moderate head of foam. The carbonation is great too, making it very sippable. Love the opening citrus notes and has that IPA bitter finish, but not over-powering. Making it perfect for different types of food pairings. I have had many other IPA's, and while they were good, I did not want another glass. Bootlegger's has an IPA that you can drink more than 1 glass and it is not too much.  ",3,4,4,4,4.5,4.04
47604,magictrokini,2009-06-10,"   Pours a murky golden-brown with a total lack of head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is flat, grainy, and plain. Some floral hops, but no rye to speak of. Some sourness, more metallic than anything else. Good mouthfeel, firm but not thick or syrupy. Decent carbonation. Taste makes up in part for what is lacking. Smooth, sweet, fruity hop flavor. Tropical and blood orange hop taste, but nothing tangy or bitter. Attribute that to the overmalted backing. Very sweet for the style. As for the rye, again, it is nearly nonexistent. Compared to a similar beer, Hop Rod Rye, this is weak and rye-free. However, this beer tastes really good. I could drink this again and again, but it misses the boat stylisticly.  ",3,3,3.5,4,4,3.5

Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of blood orange, orange peel, coriander, pear, apple, pepper, wheat, cracker, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, blood orange, and light-moderate pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of blood orange, orange peel, coriander, pear, apple, pepper, wheat, cracker, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate yeast spiciness and slight fruit bitter/tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of blood orange, orange peel, coriander, pepper, wheat, cracker, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and solid robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, blood orange, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is good; a bit thin even for a witbier. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.1%. Overall this is a very solid fruited witbier. All around good balance and solid robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, blood orange, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink.

Nice light citrus, smells like a regular IPA. T: The rye certainly comes in in the taste. Great spicy character adds complexity to the solid hop profile. Tangerine, orange, tropical notes from the hops are all there. Malt is treacly, almost cake batter at times. A really good mix of flavours. M: Smooth, creamy, robust, dry finish.

The taste: Good malty toasted rye bread flavors,a dry lemon rind mixed with a hint of blood orange gives to a good mid-palate fruit. The malt backbone softens into sweet dates and spicy rye finish.

47604,DoubleJ,2009-01-31,"   This is a new beer in Bootlegger's portfolio, an IPA with 10% rye. It tasted really nice during my tasting at the brewery, so I bought a growler to go. On to the beer: Big patchy/soapy head on top a color of beautiful clearish copper/bronze. Good head retention. Aroma...oh man, that smells good. Very citrusy, grapefruit. It bombards the nostrils. Cracks of dry biscuit and caramel. The taste is simply a good thing. It's quite balanaced, tasty...don't worry the hops sneak in towards the back. This is a very complex beer. At first, it has a slight tropical fruit flavor with a gummy feel and caramel flavors. Bready, strong earthy notes, and drying in the middle, probably from the rye, yet the hop flavor pokes through. This becomes a strong floral flavor towards the back. Very clean and dry in the finish. The easy-going mouthfeel helps things out here, and feels as light as a feather with just a tick of carbonation. It's good to find a slight twist on a popular style, particularly for the better. This is clocked at 85 IBU's, yet feels like half of that. Simply put, it is very tasty and easy to drink. I wonder how this will fare when its bottled soon? (2/25/11) - Had it again from a growler. More unbalanced than I remember. Still very clean and hoppy though.  ",4,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.32

47606,broken22,2011-01-28,   This is the first airdale beer I have had. It was a special event at a local watering hole that had this darkness paired up with bacon chocolate donuts. I got there early to make sure that I got a glass of this stuff. Now let's review this brew. This beer is dark. It looks like motor oil coming out of the ground. A nice thick creamy head formed on the pour. The head died down pretty quickly offering up the deliciousness bubbling below. Even though the head died down it never fully left. It just knew its place was out of the way and towards the rim of the glass.This beer has that sweet smell only a nice strong dark beer has. I imagine this is also because of the higher alcohol content. This beer has a crisp bitter finish that grabs your throat. I was actually quite surprised at the sharpness the flavor had on first sip. This is definitely not a beer for those that don't really enjoy dark beers. Since this beer was on cask the carbonation was perfect. It was perfect in that there was not a lot of it. While the description of this beer says that there is coffee and cocoa nibs in this thing they are not as pronounced as other beers I have had stating the same contents. I was first kind of bummed about that but then warmed up to the idea that they just bucked my expectations of what a beer made with coffee and cocoa nibs should taste like. Their idea is more in the bitter realms. Overall this was a good beer. While not my favorite I still really enjoyed it. I said earlier that this is not a beer for those that don't normally drink dark beers. Case and point my friend that accompanied me ended up giving me his beer to finish after only the first sip. I was only too happy to help him out. This beer was going fast and it did pair well with the bacon chocolate donuts.  ,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.83

Some RIS's can be syrupy and is anything but with a nice full profile holding up the grains. A hint of booze is also present - true to style. M - Great, nice and smooth so you can taste the full profile. D - Pretty good for an RIS.

The nose was complex and showed orange, pine, oak, and some leathery funk. The taste was funky through and through with a leathery dry mustiness. Underneath and quite present were the hoppy IPA notes I expected, as described in the aroma. The oak became prominent near the finish and left a lasting impression.

191226,biboergosum,2016-02-29,"   12oz bottle - a witbier, sure, until the 'natural flavors added' bit in the ingredients list. This beer pours a hazy, medium golden yellow colour, with three fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and mildly creamy bone-white head, which leaves some streaky welding arc lace around the glass as it quickly sinks out of sight. It smells of sharp orange flesh and peel, grainy, semi-sweet wheat malt, rather sugary coriander, a touch of earthy yeast, and a faint leafy and floral hop bitterness. The taste is bready and doughy pale and wheat malt, a sturdy fleshy orange fruitiness, still saccharine coriander spice notes, battened-down yeast, and more tame floral and weedy hoppiness. The carbonation is fairly active in its coddling and enveloping frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and mostly smooth, with a small airy creaminess arising as things warm up a tad. It finishes well off-dry, the still heady mixed malt contending with the equally lingering sugared spice thing to see who can make me scrape my tongue first. Overall, a simple and plain version of the style, one that seems at times overburdened by the aforementioned 'natural' flavouring, which must have been some sort of sweetened orange concentrate. Good, if you like your alco-pops, but for fans of the expected subtly of the style, this one will not please.  ",3.75,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.25,3.39

Loose mouthfeel, especially for the style. Watered-down coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Some roasted malt, but it leaned into the burnt cereal grain variety. The hop bitterness was lost in the coffee. When I had this, I initially thought it was a regular stout. If it WAS an American Stout, it would be decent.

Sorry, I thougt the explanation was warranted... Poured black with a nice, grey lace. Smell is a mixture of coffee, chocolate, and a hint of some dark fruits. Taste is a slight coca up front fading to a coffee/hoppy bitterness that lingers for a time before turning to a hint of dark, ripe fruit. A hint of alcohol is in the finish but the aftertaste trails off quickly. Mouthfeel is a on the lighter side of medium with a good amount of carbonation but not too much (I like thick stouts, however). Pretty good beer for a young brewery- worth a try  ",3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.77

Very good presentation, dark with about a half inch of fluffy foam. The head has some great retention as well. A little too cold at first and couldn't pick up much aroma so I let it warm up for a couple of minutes. After I revisited the beer I picked up some chocolate and espresso notes right away. Then some roasted barley come through and roasted malts but I didn't find too much complexity in the aroma. Later on I started to detect a sort of grainy aroma in the background. The taste was a little better than the aroma. With the first sip I got some roasted malts and chocolate malts upfront followed closely by some chocolate covered raisins, fruity and dark malts in the middle, and espresso in the finish. Good but not much to stand out from the pack. Low carbonation and the body felt a tad thin in the end. The alcohol was well hidden though. Didn't impress me as much as their Homecoming Porter but would still like to revisit this one.  ",4.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.54

It has moderate retention and spotty lacing. Aroma: It smells strongly of coffee when near the glass. It has a nice coffeehouse aroma that smells like both coffee that is brewing and coffee grounds. It smells like coffee in the classical sense and doesn't have any pepper character. Taste: There is a clear coffee flavor to the beer and it is sure to appeal to coffee drinkers. The coffee flavor in this beer is better than the flavor that most coffee shops that I have had. There is a light bit of charred carbon flavor in the background. There isn't any real independent presence of the base-beer to this beer, so either it has been overwhelmed by the coffee or it has integrated seamlessly. Either way the beer tastes outstanding. Mouthfeel: It has a medium-full body which relies heavily on the roasted flavor to deliver apparent weight to the beer. Carbonation seems right and it has just a light stickiness at the end. Overall: Taste and aroma are the heavy hitters for this beer. As a coffee beer it works wonderfully well and I would both recommend it and drink it again. If you aren't in to coffee then the beer doesn't have much to offer you in the way of a standard stout.  ",3.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.92

Taste of burnt roast malts,, tart coffee and bitter chocolate. Medium bodied and rather light for a stout, but creamy from the oatmeal. Light sticky syrup becoming drying in the end. This beer was only ""okay"" at the start, but it grew on me. Rich and smooth, it became more well rounded as it warmed. I'd definitely try it again.  ",4,3.75,4,4.25,4,3.97

There was a quarter inch of creamy, tan-colored head that lasted an average amount of time. Somewhat sparse lacing. S: A pretty good lacing of espresso, roasted malt, and some chocolate. T: Tasted of a fair amount of roasted malt, a bit of espresso (could have been more), light bittersweet chocolate, a definite lactose presence, and an oaty quality as well. Like a lot of beers, this one doesn't quite push its advertised ingredients far enough. Not terrible, but could have been stronger. F: A well-carbonated beer with a mostly smooth finish. Medium-bodied. O: This is an uneven beer for the most part. It has its good attributes, but isn't a home run.  ",4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.67

Cap and ring persists for a while. S: Coffee and dairy, roasted malts. T: Coffee, concentrated espresso coffee, and lactose. Roasted malts and flaked oats keep bitterness from running away on finish. F: Not even medium-bodied, as they made an interesting choice to keep this beer light and drinkable and I think it works nicely. Light to medium carbonation as well, so flavor lingers, but not overlong before drying. O: I'm becoming a fan of Three Notch'd in short order, at least their dark beers.

A slow, deliberate pour summons a white pillowy foam which creeps up the teku but leaves quickly. We are left with a hazy tropical juice. The mouhthfeel is special. So soft. So full of flavor.

Mouthfeel: Typical depth for a Belgian-style ale. Overall: A solid effort from Shipyard.

The aroma is pleasant, with notes of sweet orange and bready malt, but nothing really stands out about it. The taste is very underwhelming. I get barely any orange flavors at all. It's more malt than anything, and any of the citrus flavors are extremely well hidden, like biting into a dried out orange. The feel is watery with moderate carbonation. Finishes dry as a bone. Overall, I am definitely disappointed with this one. I'm not a big fan of Shipyard but I'm a sucker for orange flavors and aromas in beer. This just doesn't really have either, despite the name.

There is also the aroma of a little pepper spice, almost like a hint of bourbon oak. A drinking mate brought up Cherry 7Up, but, I didn't get that. Light oak and cherry bitters are right up front on the palate, but are nicely restrained with that classic nutty, chocolatey BORIS undercurrent.

Sporadic splotchy lacing left behind. Spicy autumnal aroma with pumpkin pie spices integrated into the roast and silky dessert-like sweetness of the base beer. Allspice, clove, pepper, nutmeg, vanilla, ginger and pumpkin purée followed by gourmet coffee beans, toast, oatmeal and silky chocolate notes. Smells pretty nice. Flavor profile is very similar to the aroma with a stronger coffee presence. Still, the earthy spices and sweet pumpkin purée dominate the palate with heavy allspice, clove, pepper, nutmeg and pumpkin flesh. The pumpkin pie notes are countered by a complex malt bill with a nice balance of roast and lighter dark malt sweetness. Gourmet coffee bean with oatmeal, toast and bittersweet dark chocolate followed by tootsie roll, German chocolate cake, caramel and toffee.

97227,KS_Augsburg,2018-07-29,"   Got introduced to this lovely WI Witbeer while in Milwaukee and staying overnight before German Fest. Ordered at the Marriott downtown, who feature a nice tap list of beers brewed exclusively in Wisconsin. For me, beer is very much associated to regions, therefore I appreciate this kind of effort. The Little Sister paired well with my halibut fish fry. The beer has a bright appearance (with a very subtle greenish hue). Foam was light, beer was semi opaque. It took a couple of sips to gather the full spectrum of flavors. What I liked particularly well is the finish - the Little Sister finishes on what I thought at first was ginger. However, later on I caught up to the fact that it is actually a coriander note. I could also detect some mint, but very slightly. Bought it in cans before heading back home - as usual, the glass poured from the tap usually tastes better. Same in this case.  ",4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.35

353454,cjgiant,2018-08-22,"   Bottle: Since many have mentioned it ,I'm thinking that without serious decanting you're going to have globules in your deep brown bodied beer. Head is a nice tan color, and ample before fading to a medium collar. Lacing is fairly strong with streaks and spots. Nose has a peanut-butter cup aspect to me. I think a slightly coffee edge to the ample dark chocolate is turning the graham cracker scent a tad sideways to my olfactory sense. Either way, add peanut butter into a s'mores and you might get this - dark chocolate, peanut butter, light char, graham, little bit of vanilla. Flavor is a bit more straightforward; it is a pastry stout, but the dark roasted malt aspects hold up decently well. The dark chocolate is a bit stealthy, but near the end it comes out quite nicely, actually. At first, a soda-influenced stout note that has a vanilla sweet lean, but not too badly. Lighter than I'd expected - medium just leaning fuller, with a muted carbonation. Slight licorice note before the dark chocolate comes on. It's actually quite interesting how the dark chocolate hits my palate, it seems to smooth the beer out and I almost get a silky feel in the end - that is until the globules started gettign involved. An interesting beer - I've had the base and the BBA version, and like both. This one was a different beast with the nose and that dark chocolate ending.  ",3.5,4,4.25,3.25,4,4

It poured with a half finger high tan head that consistently left a short head covering the surface and lots of rings of bubbles around the sides of the glass. S: Moderate aromas of chocolate and S'mores are present in the nose. T: The taste follows the smell and has lots of flavors of chocolate and S'mores with a touch of associated sweetness. M: It feels medium-bodied and a bit smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. O: This is a very nice dessert beer—you can get all of the S'mores flavors of chocolate, marshmallows and Graham crackers. Serving type: on-tap  ",4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,4.17

Thick yet not cloying, heavy body, woody, chocolate taste is dominant flavor to point it tastes like a chocolate bar; clean, easy finish with hidden booze and enjoyable as a dessert beer.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

353454,NotAlcoholicJustAHobby,2018-07-15,"   Bottled 06/07/18 L-The beer pours a dark brown to black with a 3 finger tan head. The head recedes t a thick film leaving spotty lacing in it's wake. A great pour right up until the bottle took a huge dump in my glass with what I have to hope is chocolate or residual marshmallow. The residual head looks like when you put powdered Quik in your milk and it clumps up on top. Pray for me... S- The nose is up front with huge chocolate and sweet marshmallow. Behind all of that is a fairly strong alcohol presence. T-As expected the taste follows the nose with big time chocolate which wavers between sweet milk and bitter dark chocolate. Overall it leans to the sweet side due to the marshmallow. This one is dessert stout without a doubt. F-Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium and carbonation after the initial pour is very light. O- The beer delivers on it's promise of huge chocolate. Unfortunately it suffers for this in the appearance which was decidedly off putting after the initial pour. Its not a bad beer if your can get past the appearance, but is decidedly too sweet to be anything but a nightcap dessert beer.  ",3.25,4.25,4.25,3.75,3.75,4.04

79167,Gosox8787,2012-06-15,"   Presentation: 22 oz. bomber bottle purchased a couple weeks ago. Served chilled into a pint glass. Appearance: Pours a really full, creamy, three finger head with nice retention. Light caramel brown in color, much darker than I am used to for the style. Aroma: The earthy quality of the pineapple sage really stands out. There is a caramel background that stands out nicely. Some belgian yeast tones are there as well, not really funky but very light. Taste: The sage notes really do well to make a nice earthy, bitter background that remains refreshing. There is a lot of caramel that really comes through from the malt and I'm not sure it works completely. A touch of lemon in there as well. Pretty refreshing. Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. A little creamy as well. Overall, a really nice and interesting saison. The pineapple sage really works well and makes the beer in my opinion by creating a nice earthy and bitter background. The caramel tones from the malt are a bit overdone, but overall this is a nice, refreshing take on the style.  ",3.5,4,4,4,4,3.97
79167,deltatauhobbit,2012-05-05,"   Pours a dark amber color with hints of orange trying to get through, smallish head but there seems to be a fair amount of sticky lacing on the glass, surprisingly clear, I would have expected it to be more cloudy. Smell has a good aroma, picking up some light fruit notes, citrus, bit of an earthy herb scent as well, sweet malt to balance things out, lots going on with the nose. Taste actually has a bit of an earthy bitterness to it which is surprising at first, soon however the sweetness comes into play, banana is quite prevalent, lightly spicy with citrus hints, sweetness from the malt smooths things over a bit, medium to high carbonation with a decent body. Pineapple sage is an interesting component, I think it lends a nice earthy component while also imparting some nice lemon-like citrus.  ",3.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.79

Really dark color for a saison. The nose is of toasted nuts, prickly band-aid/medicinal/phenolic funk, and some slight notes of tangerine. The band-aid notes dominate. On the palate, toasted nuts and caramel hit the palate first before a rush of band-aid/herbal/medicinal funk sweeps through. This is not your typical saison. Much heavier, stickier malt foundation than most with a prickly carbonation that takes away from the overall flavor as well as feel. Medium body, heavier than it should be. Carbonation is way too high. The feel should be soft and delicate, this is almost the opposite. I applaud these guys for trying something different and the flavor profile isn't all that bad, it's just the carbonation throws everything off.  ",3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,3.1

Finishes with a light yet odd bitterness M: Medium bodied with moderate-high carbonation O: A little different than the saisons I'm used to, but not bad.

The problem is the label calls it an IPA and the hop profile leaves a lot to be desired. The floral, piney, citrus as promised is almost non existent, & the beer winds up tasting like a malty English bitter.

Beautiful tropical fruit coming off the nose gives way to solid hoppy backing. Very juicy, nice orange, mango aroma emerging from the top of this beaut of a beer. Smell is on point with what you expect from this. Taste: The taste is exotic. Fruity, juicy, very very well balanced. Bitter like a DIPA but oh so juicy! The fruit aroma hits the back of your mouth as you're left with an overwhelming sweet, but incredible taste begging for another sip. This my friends, is the filet mignon of DIPAs. Feel: feel is wholesome. Very filling, smooth, and pleasant. You can feel the complexity that gets brewed into this beer. From the taste to the feel, this scores 100 all around.

There is actually even some lacing. Smell is dominated by coffee early. After some warmth, the coffee settles down, though remains the primary component of the nose. The oat grain adds a toasted bread note eventually. The taste is bitter coffee - somewhat astringent on a cold brew, more tolerable as it warms. The coffee seems to lend a bunch of bitterness to the 30 IBU listed on the bottle. The oat adds some dryness and the feel that I associate with oatmeal stouts - a light grainy chalkiness. A roasted bitter lighter oatmeal stout. I think it is decently constructed, but could use a little sweet malt flavor for balance.  ",3.75,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.75

The foam faded very quickly to nothing after the pour. The aroma is lots of roasted malt and dark cocoa. Some coffee grounds and a bit of charred notes mixed in as well. I dont get any hops on the nose for this beer. The first sip reveals an average body with fine and gentle carbonation that is almost cask like and non-existent. Easy drinking physical traits on this beer. texture is a little sticky after each swallow. Flavor is all malt, with roasted notes and dark chocolate coming out first and then some good char notes and coffee grounds come through too. The coffee ground lingers and is actually fairly bitter, still no hops this is a black coffee kinda bite and definitely sticks around. A little bit acidic here too. I dont get any hints of the booze and find this stout very drinkable, but the char could be a little much if you arent really into that flavor profile.

The brewers were kind enough to mention it is a stout with lighter mouthfeel and that it was sessionable. That description would have scared me a away had I read it. Pours jet black. Cola-like head that lasts a minute or so. Smell- Faint coffee but primarily roastred malts Tastes really earthy. Burnt coffee and acid. Not great tasting. The aftertaste is acidic. Mouthfeel-Again, they were kind enough to warn me, but it is light and thin and not at all stout-like. Overall- One of the lesser stouts I;ve had.

They CAN really use a proofreader. If only they knew of a Navy retiree in the area with a B.A. in English Literature ... I Crack!ed the CAN open & began a slow, gentle Glug, but when nothing seemed to be amiss, I increased the flow into the awaiting glass. This was a mistake on my part as it seemed to suddenly erupt with an unCANtrollable amount of foam. It finally settled into just under three fingers of foamy, soapy, rocky, deep-brown head with poor retention that quickly fell away to wisps. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose was roasty, but I was put in mind of baker's/baking chocolate, rather than coffee. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was definitely coffee, but I also got a grainy dustiness of baker's chocolate, which was nice, but I would have preferred that the coffee be a bit more assertive, since it was prominent on the label. Finish was dry, coffee-like and certainly pleasant after a day of Stouts & whisky for St. Patrick's Day.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.56

Aroma has some mineral character upfront blending to earth, char, roast, tobacco and faintest coffee. Taste sadly has that mineral note right upfront almost tin-like metallic with bitter roastiness and a touch of citrus. Light in body with modest carbonation.

125646,Nugget40,2017-03-07,"   Another home run from Treehouse. Haze pours a turbid, pale yellowish orange, looks just like pineapple/orange juice in the glass. A lasting one finger head. The smell is big beautiful orange, mango, tropical fruit, a bit of peach. Taste follows the nose, orange, citrus, tropical fruits, just a touch for dankness hiding in the back. Very soft bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, like a velvet pillow of fruit in your mouth. Overall this one of the best IPA/DIPAs I have had, in the top 3 from Treehouse for me, Bright being my favorite.

Smell is tropical fruit/hop juice that hits you in the face with notes of orange, peach, mango, and pineapple. Some light resin and honey is coming trough as well. Taste follows the nose with orange pulp most noticeable. There is a little bit of sweetness and low bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy with good body upfront and a great bite on the finish. Overall, this is probably the best IPAs I have tasted. The tropical fruit and earthy hop flavors are unreal, yet the drinkability and balance are great. The bitterness is perfectly placed, and there is just enough sweetness. Just about perfect all the way around.  ",5,5,5,5,5,5

323440,StonedTrippin,2018-08-13,"   this series of beer has been amazing, i have had four of them now, not sure how many there have been, and while syrah is definitely my favorite of them, i derived a ton of satisfaction from this one, a really cool expression of this grape, its intense, vinous, and delicious, one of their best in awhile. the color is this gorgeous shade of purple, the likes of which i have rarely seen, looks more wine than beer, so much fruit in this! not much head, but i dont miss it. the aroma is awesome, this one as much actual grape as it is wine, some of the others have been straight wine, i like the tart skins with the light bacterial pucker, this one much sweeter and less sour than the riesling edition. great funk and oak too, this is so dialed in and unique. the flavor is as good as the nose, a bit sweet for a moment, really ripe summery fruit though, its natural and awesome. i get a little of that dry cerealy thing towards the finish but not much malt really here at all, a large portion of the fermentables obviously coming from the grapes. the flavors are so dense, but yet the beer drinks oddly light, its so interesting, juicy, tannic, woody, a little less bretty and lambic-esque than the riesling, but quite funky in its own right. i want to try these after some time in the cellar, but the prices are absurd. awesome series of beers though, i loved this one.  ",4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.32

Aroma is acceptable, with a little bit of fruitiness, and a hint of toffee. Flavor has moderate bitterness and a citrus rind flavor in between lemon and grapefruit. Is this the dankest beer ever? No. Does it smell like acapulco gold, plushberry, sunset sherbet, or lemon meringue? I don't know. It's a fine AIPA, fairly drinkable, and a little bit dank.  ",3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.69

The aroma featured floral and citrus hops, with a nice grain scent in the background. Fairly similar on the tongue, lots of interesting hop flavors, and a solid grainy malt foundation. The body was fairly typical for the style, and had a dry finish. Drinkability was very good, I could knock back a few of these.

47655,philbertk,2010-12-31,   Atwater Block Brewery--Michigan Lager--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV. 38 IBU's. (3.5 / 5.0) Pilsner. Foamy lacy thin white head. Fizzy clear bright yellow gold color. Sediment dust. Mild Noble hop Pilsner front. Fizzy crisp thin zesty refreshing mild flavored pils/pale lager mild citrus body. Clean dry subtle hop spice crisp end. Too fizzy & somewhat bland.

47655,scoobybrew,2010-12-08,"   This was rated as a German pilsner - not Vienna lager. It's declared right on the label. A - fairly clear with a decent foamy white head that settles into a well retained collar and leaves nice lacing S - diacetyl (buttered popcorn) initially and behind it some grainy malt T - brief sweet malt intially with a strong noble hop like flavor and a moderately strong bitter hop finish; diacetyl is lighter in flavor but in aroma, but still present to a mild degree M - medium-light body with high carbonation D - This would be a decent version of a German pilsner if it weren't for the diacetyl. It's a shame too because I think the hopping and malt are just right to style.  ",4,2,2.5,4,2.5,2.62
47655,mooseisloose,2010-12-04,"   Last of my current selection of my BOTMC as the clowns did repeat on one of the beers from 15 months ago. Well all is not lost, let's give this one a whirl. Popping the top I get a dry malty smell of white grapes and malted milk balls. Pours to a slightly cloudy yellow with a thin fizzy head that fades quickly. Taste is very rich and malty with only a twinge of bitterness from albeit, noble hops. The taste is quite bold and consistent throughout with the difference at the end. This brew is quite fresh and flavorful and spot on for the style. Very German and authentic not like a BMC Llave or Girl. This brew is growing on me as I drink it, I've never been much for this style but this brew is extremely hearty. Thumbs up and bottoms up!  ",3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.02
47655,OneDropSoup,2010-09-23,"   Poured into a pilsner: Massive head, like four fingers minimum, fast-rising & billowing white. Light gold body, clear, with quick nucleation. Leaves messy stripes of lacing. Smells of hops that are earthy, maybe a little grassy, & dry. Sourdough bread? Even matzo? Just a dry, crisp, crusty baked good. Kind of like walking into a winery, too, that woody smell. Hmm, did not expect it to taste like that: smooth lemon, a little peach, some wheaty malt, tea-like dryness & a touch peppery. The way the flavors blend reminds me much more of a Belgian blonde than a lager. Some bitterness in the aftertaste, but also the fruitiness. Not bad, but very unexpected. Feels fairly smooth with a little bite in the finish & bitterness afterward. Not sure what to think of this one. What I had wasn't bad, but it did seem off, & I'm wondering if that *just* means off-style or not. Label says April 2010 -- I'm assuming that means ""Bottled on"" & not ""Best by."" Can't say I'd like a lot of these in a row, but this was enjoyable enough. I'd be up for trying it again to see how another sampling compares.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.53
47655,Cyberkedi,2010-07-08,"   Comes out of the tap a clear pale yellow with a typical white head - not inspiring. Fortunately, this is its weakest point.

Nothing to write home about, but definitely worth a try!  ",2,3,3,4,3,3.04
47655,Frosty80,2010-01-14,"   Color: pours a light amber. sits a brilliantly clear dark amber Smell: definitely rich in german malt but also has a surprising sour aroma. i also agree with others that there is a kind of metallic note there as well. light hop presence Taste: the malt is soft and definitely apparent over the light hop presence. slight toasted note. bitterness is very low. finish is very dry with malt and hop in aftertaste Mouthfeel: light-medium body. gentle creaminess with moderate carbonation. Notes: tasty amber. fairly true to the style but im wondering about the ""sour"" notes. not experienced enough i guess to determine if its off or just me not familiar with something  ",4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.06
47655,civilizedpsycho,2009-12-29,"   Poured bottle into pint glass. Appearance: On the one hand, I say: It has a nice golden color that is slightly cloudy with a small head...appealing. On the other hand I say: That's not a Vienna Lager. Smell: Has a good malt smell with what seems like a hint of lemon or something. Not much hop presence, but inviting. Taste: Very smooth and refreshing. I felt it has a good balance between malt and hops and really kept me wanting more. Mouthfeel: Has a fair body, but nothing out of the ordinary. Drinkability: I really like this beer. Every once in a while, I find myself desiring a light, gold lager that's just good and not crazy complex. In that case, instead of reaching for a big macro beer, I can reach for this better, locally made beer. I still think the style is off, though, but I guess if you like it, it doesn't matter.  ",3.5,3.5,4,3,4.5,3.85
47655,danielharper,2009-12-21,"   A: Dingy yellow-orange body, completely transparent, with precisely no head. S: A mild orangey citrus aroma up front with a corn lager backbone. The citrus is unexpected, to say the least, but not at all unwelcome. T: Sweet corn, somewhat dry, with a nice yeasty complex citrus finish. Sweet aftertaste. Finishes clean. M: I'm tempted to say ""moderate"" thickness, but that's really only considering the style. It's thin and goes down smooth, but is a tiny bit richer than you'd expect from a lager. D: It's tough to rate this one. If you compare it to other commerically-available Vienna Lagers, this one seems to miss the mark. It's not nearly dark enough, for one, and it lacks the malty complexity I expect from a nice Vienna. But viewed as a microbrewery's answer to macro lagers, this is a nice change of pace. Overall, I find myself enjoying this quite a bit, even if it doesn't have the kind of complexity that leaves me wanting more. I'd buy it again. Maybe.  ",2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.41

Drinkable but nothing I would buy again.  ",3,2.5,2,2,2.5,2.28
47655,carlborch,2009-07-22,   Pours like a clear golden lager. Nice creamy white-off-white head formation. Moderate carbonation. The head dissipates quickly and the lager leaves virtually no Belgian lacing. Sweet notes of hay on the nose. Appears very light on malt and hops. The body is unexpectedly light. Very soft on the palate. The label suggests traditional German methods. What exactly do they mean by that? Is this an all-malt brew? For me it is too light and bright for Vienna Lager and too low on hops and malt for the Helles moniker. Makes me think of Schlitz rather than Spaten. The lingering is only moderately pleasant.  ,3,2,1.5,2.5,2,1.91

Taste is very chocolatey with wonderfully integrated sweet maple and some roastiness. Not much bourbon flavor, and not much woodiness, but there is a hint of vanilla. Has a bit of a cola flavor cold out of the fridge, but that disappears as it warms up. Not at all boozy. Smooth and full with low carbonation.  Overall, it's flavors compliment one another, and nothing overpowers. A very fine stout, but I wouldn't pay the price again.  ",4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4.24

I finally got the opportunity to get this beer. I first got this when it was released earlier this year. It is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A medium-hard pour produced a one finger head with excellent retention. The head is a dark brown and left lacing on the glass as it dissipated. The color of the beer is SRM 37 a dark brown nearing black. The clarity of the beer is opaque. The aromas in the beer are dark roasted malt, molasses, maple, citrus, vanilla, dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, earthy, wood, yeast, and bready.

47658,StJamesGate,2018-09-17,"   On tap at Underdog, Dublin. Jet with tan film; cigars, leather + burnt sugar with mulch, black grape + ash; ganache, purple Fruit Pastilles, sweet licorice, a meaty middle, then intense woody maple with a firm roasty end; big + dead smooth. 4 4.5 4.5 4.25 4.25 Serious nose - deep notes like tobacco. The miracle here is how it gets the flavors of so many sweet things - licorice, maple, chocolate - without actually being sugary. Cuts the boozy burn of KBS, though it stops short of being a better beer. Lervig Maple wins as far as straight up maple character. And this does go a bit candy as it warms; I find myself wishing for more roast. Ultimately needs some taming: doesn’t cloy exactly but missing that bit of balance. Still, overall, a class act.  ",4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.4

47658,stephens101,2018-09-13,"   A matte black brew covered with a fluffy, dark tan froth. Looks like it oughta look. Redolent of maple syrup, milk chocolate, black cherry, cotton candy and coffee. A bombshell of dark fruity flavors hit the tongue before notes of maple syrup, cinnamon and pine are noticed. A drop of espresso adds complexity. Silky smooth and medium to heavy in body with a noticeable bouron finish. Fabulously sweet and never cloying. This is the smoothest beer of this magnitude that I can remember tasting. This is one beer that is all that it is cracked up to be.  ",4.25,4.25,4.75,4,4.5,4.48

47658,dcotom,2018-09-10,"   Pours an oily black, with a slightly aggressive pour yielding scads of thick tan long-lasting head and tons pf pretty lacing. This hits its stride at just below room temperature, when all of the aromas and flavors seem to snap into balance. Bourbon is prominent as expected. Big aromas and flavors of chocolate, coffee, and black cherry, with notes of maple peeking through as the beer warms. There is a touch of espresso-bean bitterness that is balanced by a subtle underlying sweetness. This is a big beer, to be sure, but there's nothing over the top about it. Everything integrates perfectly. Well worth the expense.  ",5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.63

Low level bourbon. Flavors are a nice balance of deep roast malt and maple with some very low levels of bourbon. Mouthfeel was excellent. All in all...was hoping for more here.

Smell has notes of pepper, pine sol, coriander, ginger and white pepper. Bit heavy on the pepper and not much orange here. Taste follows the nose with notes of pepper, ginger, coriander, and pine - rather spicy up front. Not much orange peel - its largely suppressed by the ginger/pepper flavors. Feel is light and drinkable. Rather heavy carbonation. Lively and fizzy. Overall a solidly average witbier. Id like to get more orange out of this, but its alright as is.  ",3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.4

This smells fruity with caramel, dates and raison-like appeal. A mild amount of papery oxidation and kick of solvent alcohol towards the back. This tastes sweet and fruity like raisons covered in papery oxidation with fruity alcohol esters and almost plum-like with bready grain and a hint of herbal bitterness.

It has a sweet caramel flavor throughout and as it warms I'm getting some smoky flavors as well. Aging has definitely rounded out the edges here but it has a pecuilar peppery finish that I'm not the biggest fan of.

51254,Kegatron,2009-07-18,"   On tap @ the Harrisburg location on 7/17/09. Served in an over sized mug. Pours a murky brown, with a thin covering of light tan head. Retains mostly around the edges, with some thin wisps that float around the center, leaving back a decent amount of spotty lace. The aroma is initially sweet, with notes of bread, roast, and clove, before blending into some yeasty banana notes and light warmth. The taste is bread and spice with a yeasty bloom of banana. Some firmer feeling bitterness pulls up the back. Much like the aroma, the malts in this are coming off as much more toasty than for what I would expect in this style (which are fairly darker to begin with). Not really saying that it took away from the profile but it was a bit different. The finish is dry and roasty, and is where I can really detect the darker malts here. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a sharp and prickly carbonation, maybe actually being a tad too over carbonated towards the back. This is still fairly crisp and mostly easygoing. There is definitely some presence to this but I didn't pick up any alcohol at all in the taste, so I'm guessing maybe around 5-6% ABV on this one? Overall not bad. I wish that the aroma had given up a bit more and the roastiness of this was quite interesting, but I won't hold that against it. I love a good Dunkel and although this didn't quite blow me a way, it was pretty decent by ABC standards.  ",,,,,,3.38

Aroma consists of dry caramel malt with light bitter hoppy notes. Taste is also dominated by some dry caramel malt with some hoppy bitter notes that are not as powerful as I would have expected. Body is light with good carbonation. Too much dry caramel malts for its own good with hops that fell way short considering the style.  ,3.5,3,2.75,2.75,3,2.91

The aroma is herbal and fruity hops mingling with fresh bread and light roasty malts. Grapefruit, melon and grape skin hop flavors and an assertive bitterness dominate the taste. Chewy, caramel malts are very prominent. Alcohol spice is quite noticeable for the ABV. The mouthfeel is light bodied and moderate to lightly carbonated. Some slick coating and booze heat detracts. The finish is moderately bitter and a bit boozy. This is an ok, if somewhat distracted IPA. Too much malt in the flavor and an immodest alcohol presence for the strength.

A: Black with 1/2-finger of dark tan, big-bubbled head with good retention and a few streamers of lacing. S: Big coffee-espresso aroma with dark chocolate and some dark malt roastiness. There is a bit of caramel sweetness in the aroma as well. T: The black coffee/bitter espresso flavor is overwhelming and knocks down all of the stout quality in the flavor. The caramel and dark malt notes in the aroma are definitely lost in the flavor component of this beer. No alcohol or yeast component. M: Very smooth milky feel with low carbonation and medium body. O: Overboard on the coffee component, but if that was toned down sufficiently, I feel these guys could put together a coffee-forward, but better-balanced stout than this offering. I finished it, but it was a bit of work.  ",3.75,4.25,3.25,4,3.5,3.65

A lite spice to go along with it. Taste: All the fruits combined with a juicy flavor. The blend is super drinkable with no taste of alcohol for a double IPA ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Feel: Next to no bitter with a little stickiness. Just enough carbonation to add a kick to the drink. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Overall: Another fantastic Tree House brew. I appreciated the higher ABV as I drank my second one.

326095,JerzDevl2000,2018-04-13,"   Gotta hand it to Greenpoint - they know how to brew a great beer inside of a funky can that you can't forget. This was sweet to a t but not to excess, as the booze and resin was enough to keep it at bay, and ensure that this would be more than a one-trick pony. It wasn't a publicity stunt as the images on the can would indicate, but this grew on me as it warmed up and quickly became one of the better brews that I've had from them. Good pour to this as the beer was golden, fairly cloudy, and topped off with a near-perfect head. Tons of lacing was left behind in the form of solid rings that slid down into the next. A good amount of vanilla, orange, cream, sherbert, and mild stone fruit in the nose with all of those coming through in the taste in a fairly unified flavor. A sense of marmalade and honey came over me as this warmed up and while it was a proverbial ""publicity stunt"", this was so darned taste and easygoing that I had a hard time pacing myself through it. This felt more like dessert than an American Double / Imperial IPA, since the sweetness was that strong here and the alcohol wasn't terribly noticeable. A good amount of body and light carbonation allowed the flavors and hops to shine through as this wasn't terribly dank at the same time. Others may not find enjoyment in this but I thought this was fun and tasty and at the end of the day, what more could you ask for in a beer. The label turned out to be the icing on the proverbial cake!  ",4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.19

Taste - extremely sweet. Not bitter at all, but just kind of sickeningly sweet. A bit of candied fruit at the end. Mouthfeel - light carbonation, full bodied. Definitely chewy. Overall - not into it. Too sweet, not enough anything else. Definitely disappointing given how good most of their beers are, but this was kind of gross, top to bottom.  ",2.5,3,2.75,4,2.75,2.92

Taste is fruity and acidic, puckering with moderate sourness. Lime dominates but not one dimensional due to the kumquat, which maybe adds some unique floral notes. Light bodied with a nice brisk acidity that scrubs the palate. Overall it's nice, crisp and fruity.  ",4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.18

290995,woodychandler,2018-01-11,"   I am CANstantly being enCANouraged to get The CANQuest (tm) back on track & I am doing my best, but the pesky bottles keep popping up like toadstools. C'est la guerre! From the CAN: ""Precisely balanced""; ""Cold Gold Crafted in Maryland""; ""Craft be cherished. Rules be damned.""; ""So fun it should be illegal! A throwback to a simpler time, this traditional light golden, German-style Pilsner is medium-bodied and crisp with a precise balance of malt and hop flavors that is always on target. Toss it back and you'll agree, when it comes to refreshment, Lawn Dart is a BULLSEYE!"" I live for the Crack! of a CAN and following that, I went with a gentle Glug into the awaiting glass. Color was a surprisingly light Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. I then gave it a vigorous in-glass swirl to raise a finger of dense, foamy, bone-white head with decent retention. Nose was quite biscuity & malty & my mouth began to water. I have really come to enjoy Pilsners and while the Czech-style is my favorite, I have no bones with a German-style Pils. Mouthfeel was medium, but full for the style. The taste had a pronounced biscuity breadiness along with a soft Saaz hops grassiness. Mmm. Finish was semi-dry to dry and quite refreshing. Their putting it in CANs was a masterstroke since it would be perfect on a hot, humid summer's day during a spirited game of lawn darts. I CAN totally see filling a cooler with these CANs!  ",3.5,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.9

I did let it sit for 5-10 mins though. Black as the darkest night body. Good sized coffee with just a dash of cream head. Lacing only average. Nice enticing aroma lightly coffee & chocolate, faint hit of booze. What a balance! no one flavor overpowers the other. Coffee & chocolate are both only a hint. It seems to this palate that the bourbon is balanced out by the maple syrup. Even the basic stout seems very solid. Top notch. Mouth and feel is about as good a taste as I've ever experienced. Manages to be full but not heavy on the mouth. Finish is a delightfully slightly sweet warmth. Overall, top notch BA imperial stout with the sweet add ons. can see why people go nuts for this.  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,5,4.5,4.65

Exceptional look. S - Barrel front and forward, with lots of wood notes combined with strong alcohol, vanilla. A bit one-dimensional here, it had me worried. T - No worries here. The flavor is rich and full, with multiple layers. The open is roasted malts and powerful vanilla and bourbon hits, followed by a more pungent sweetness with maple elements. Coffee and semisweet chocolate notes come in with acidity and a mild bitterness in the finish that is just enough to prevent this heavy duty stout to avoid overpowering my palate. As it warms, dark fruit and dark chocolate come forward, while maple lingers on the tail end. M - Decent but mild carbonation. The feel is sticky and full, an expected weight, with a warmth from its nearly 12% ABV, and just enough dryness in the close when coupled with the carbonation to scrub the tongue free and open it up for more. O - I'd given up chasing this one, but I got the chance to pick up a bottle last fall, and I am certainly happy I did. It is a style that I drink only on occasion, but delicious and rich, with great depth.  ",4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.54

About an inch and a half marshmallow creme colored head. Minimal lacing. The foam dissipated quick leaving a ring around the glass behind. Carbonation trickles up from the bottom in spots. Smell: Lots of malt, caramel, apple, raisin, hints of what smells like oak and booze. Taste: Wow, pretty close to the nose. Strong malts and sweet fruits with a soft sweet alcohol and caramel finish. Mouthfeel: Medium, borderline high-low mouthfeel. A bit of tacky coating lines the mouth after the swallow. Carbonation is very low. Overall: I find this offering from Saint Arnold pretty damn tasty. I love the malt and caramel sweetness throughout. If I had a chance to score another DR12 I would take it.  ",3.75,4,4,4,4,3.99

Tastes a typical Witbier.. pretty well made! Spice and Bread dough :) a good beer if you like the hard to appreciate crafty style of bier! (which it took time but.... YES!). If i have a dislike about this one its how WEEK the finish is and the mouth feel is lighter than I like but... overall not at a bad brew. Proost!  ,4.5,3.75,4.5,3,4.25,4.12

Funky as hell with citrus, spice , ginger and vermouth. Palate is tart, vinous, bright,, with mild tannins. Rose and strawberry notes are present. The spice blend really pairs beautifully with the citrusy vermouth notes, especially on the palate. Medium-light in body, moderately carbonated, this beer has a long with with vermouth, some funk and citrus. Excellent stuff.  ",,,,,,4.3

Perhaps one of the best heads I've seen on a beer. Smells of mango, apricots, ruby red grapefruit, and kiwi ... pithy and rind-like with lots of juice. Super juicy, juice box juicy. Very smooth with some body. A kiss of malt, hops are obviously dominant here. Slight bitterness but it is soft. A bit pungent within all of this juicy character.

A restrained but present crackery and bready malt backbone. Silky mouthfeel.  ",4.25,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.53
125646,ichorNet,2017-01-18,"   Split a can of this with my roommate and good friend Chris, who snagged it as a trade from his work buddy. Cheers Chris! I've had the privilege of having several Tree House beers in the past, but not this one as far as I recall (I think I'd probably remember having this if I did). Pours an opaque orange color as expected with a very retentive bone-white head of foam that sticks around at about a finger with some splotchy lace here and there. The head that remains is very consistent and the surface of the beer bears it quite well. Not everyone is into these turbid ""milkshake"" looking IPAs, but if you are, this is certainly a nice looking one. Very clean and well-defined hop profile that straddles the line between tropical and citrusy hops very closely. Not much malt here at all other than a subtle wheaty backbone that nevertheless fades behind the hop qualities. I get a lot of peach, orange, grapefruit peel, papaya, mango and even some ripe blueberry in here. Kind of seems like Mosaic combined with some older school hops to me. A tad bit of doughy yeast in there as well. On the tongue, this is super bright with candied citrus, mango, papaya and other tropical fruits up front followed closely by some more citrus and even a little pine towards the finish as a slight bitterness takes hold. I'm surprised this doesn't drink like an 8+% beer at all; it's very drinkable and even ""crushable"" although the idea of crushing this is almost blasphemous to me. Pure orange juice in the middle, with some peach and apricot flavors lingering a bit before the mostly dry close. I say mostly dry because there's a slight flash of juiciness even right at the end, alongside a tough and lingering bitterness. Just great. Drinkability is, of course, very high as well. These guys don't really know how to make a bad IPA, and the combination of heavy amounts of suspended proteins in the final product and oats in the mash give this a soft, smooth feel with a moderate carbonation and chewy body. This doesn't drink anywhere close to 8%, as stated before, so the alcohol presence is fairly muted and doesn't really play into the flavor until the glass gets closer to room temperature. Even then, it's hardly as present as many other lower-ABV DIPAs out there right now. Simply world-class. Love it.  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.74

Aroma is nice, very powerful. Juicy (orange, mango, peach), also a hoppy/floral scent as well. It has a really nice scent. Taste is juice. I've never had a beer like it, that tastes so smooth and flavourful. It hides its ABV content and really just goes down easy.

125646,Gumbo_gravy,2017-01-10,   Poured from a 16 oz can into a Aslin Beer Co stemmed glass. Canned 11-20-2016. Appear: poured beautiful orange juice haze with a about a fingers worth of foam that disapiated pretty quickly. gorgeous lacing is left along as you rock the glass. Smell: Holy Orange Juice rolls into stone fruit and topical notes some peaches and magoes great herbal and earthy dankness. there's also some candied orange rind going which is nice. Taste: orange creamsicle on the palate. delicious piney sappy notes on the finish. There's also some of the same mango and tropical fruit notes you get on the nose. The pithy piney notes do build as you sip but not in a bad way. It actually makes the beer more balanced. Mouth: some silky and so smooth. medium feel. I don't know that it can get any better. Over: Delicious reminds me of Pineal by Tired Hands. Great drinking experience. 8.2% where it's hidden. Could be 4.2% for what I could tell. Very well balanced between the great silky juicy notes and the sappy bitter notes. Great brew. RIght up my ally.  ,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.54

47658,Cwrw,2018-07-12,"   I guess Founders is quite new to Alberta, so I was stoked to find this in my local shop. Certainly seems to have a great deal of hype surrounding it. Let's see if it sends me to beer heaven. 355 bottle with the Canadian mounted police label. 2017 release. Pours into my tulip glass a severely dark colour, with a great looking fine-bubbled mocha head which sticks around as a good foam-top. Great, full sheets of lacing, and that head has retention, man. Looks stellar. First whiff reveals raisins and hot chocolate. Definitely some vanilla and maple in there. Dusty malts, burnt toast, figs/prunes and lots of licorice. It's nice. I admit I was expecting a little more. The usual dark fruit/chocolate/vanilla aromas are here, and they're all very nice, I guess I was just expecting something transcendent. The perils of reading reviews before you try a beer yourself, I guess. I mean, it's a fantastic smelling beer, but I've definitely smelt its equal, and some have been better. Lots of vanilla and raisins now, as the beer breathes a bit in my glass. Like spiced hot chocolate. Taste is better than the aroma, imo. Mouthfeel is full and creamy like hell. Absolutely glides over the tongue in an oily slick fashion. Beautiful. Chocolate/licorice/raisins predominate, along with plenty of lactic qualities. It's sweet with that maple but not overmuch--in fact is had a medium-dry finish and the sugar doesn't feel cloying. Nice. Plenty of woody vanilla aftertaste, and very little alcohol in the finish, making this a dangerous beast to be sure. This warms the insides very quickly. Ok, this is good. The aroma had me a little tentative, but the taste and mouthfeel made up for it. Indeed a pretty solid imperial stout. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it definitely reaches that top tier.  ",4.25,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.22

47658,biboergosum,2018-07-04,"   12oz bottle - so what exactly makes this 'Canadian'? That it is aged in Bourbon barrels infused with Michigan maple syrup? Riddle me that. This beer pours a solid black abyss, with the scantest of amber basal edges, and four fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and bubbly brown head, which leaves some stellar random cobwebbed lace around the glass as it slowly sinks away. It smells of rich medium chocolate, maple sugar cookies, a subtle Bourbon oakiness, thick cafe-au-lait, some weak toasted graininess, and very tame earthy, musty, and floral green hop bitters. The taste is bready and doughy caramel malt, bittersweet cocoa pudding, maple-vanilla cream doughnuts, ephemeral day-old coffee, a still kind of sneaky American whiskey woodiness, some mild free-range char, and an ephemeral earthy, herbal, and floral hoppiness. The carbonation is pretty low-key in its comatose-seeming frothiness, the body a tenable heavyweight, and actually quite smooth, with a slick creaminess slowly evolving as we move along here. It finishes sweet, the malt, chocolate, and maple/vanilla all coming along for the lingering ride. Overall - yup, this is indeed a well-constructed brew, and I always appreciate not getting smacked across the palate with the wood. The sugary flavours meld very nicely, and the 11.71 points of the ol' wowee sauce are equally and expertly integrated. Great stuff!  ",4.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.23

47658,rcjennings,2018-06-28,"   2017 edition. Bottle. I’m not sure why, but today just fet like the right day to do this. By myself. There’s no way for this beer to live up to the hype at this point, and it seems like most people have been disappointed, but I think I’m into this. Actually, I’m getting more into it with every sip. It’s incredibly drinkable for the ABV - which means I’m probably going to be a little drunk very soon. The bitterness from the coffee - maybe the whiskey, but I think it’s the coffee - was a bit much at first, but the maple is really showing up as it warms, so it’s pretty damn balanced. I guess it’s not as thicc as we want it to be - I drank DBR yesterday, which was basically chocolate sauce - but if Jackie O’s could figure out how to get this kind of body into their BA brews, the beer world would collectively cream. So I don’t think I want this to be sludge because I wouldn’t want to drink a whole 750 of it. I don’t like the idea of labeling something as “perfect,” because there’s usually something that could improve even a little bit, but this is close.  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.74

86645,taxandbeerguy,2013-11-04,"   Interesting orange and blue from LCBO for $2.65 CDN served cold and poured into a pint glass. Appearance - Hazy orange / Brown (Burnt Orange?) color is poured. Some sediment in the glass is apparent especially near the end of the pour. Rocky 1 finger of head wasn't doing a ton for me right away, it looked nice and all but the longer it lingered the more impressed I became. Trace amounts of lacing left on the glass and some effervescent bubbles in the glass. Smell - Not a ton here some mild hops and floral presence is there. The hops are pleasant on the nose but a little more subdued than expected. Taste - Grapefruit is in here that wasn't apparent on the nose gives it a nice bitter taste, however it is not overpowering. The beer transitions into a maltier back end and the transition from one to another is well done. These are the two stars of this beer and there's not a lot else here but it is well executed. Vague caramel taste in there too. Mouthfeel - Nice balance between watery and thirst quenching and the rich creamier ale feel. Medium / low carbonation. Overall - A good IPA, with a solid kick, never is the 6.5% detected. It is a bit on the simple side, because there are fewer elements going on so this may be a good beer for introducing someone new to beer drinking to the American IPA style. Wasn't blown away, but if someone offered me one (and they don't know much of anything about beer) I would be very pleasantly surprised.  ",4,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.57

86645,NedShakeshaft,2013-10-12,"   Poured from the can. Left a fluffy eggshell-white head with excellent retention. As it faded, it left splotchy, white residue as if it were marshmallow melting over hot chocolate. The beer itself is an appropriate goldfish orange. Smells like a creamsicle! Some note of pine and earth as well but the sweetness dominates the nose. I'll get to the taste but I'm going to start with the mouthfeel as it made the first and longest-lasting impression on me. It's cream and velvety. A bit thin for an IPA, but so smooth. A lot of malt upfront. Bready caramel. Dry and bitter finish, some lingering orange peel. It's mildly hopped for an IPA. Some pine notes, a bit earthy and citrusy. Overall, a delicious IPA but its only exceptional trait is its drinkability. I'd happily a bunch of these for a night of watching sports and eating pizza and wings with friends.  ",3.75,3.75,3.5,4.25,3.75,3.7
86645,Jeffo,2013-09-16,"   Got this one at the LCBO From a 16oz can into a snifter APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, medium looking, off-white head with great retention. Fades to a thin film and sticks to the sides of the glass. hazy burnt orange with next to no carbonation evident. Splotchy wisp remains leaving dots of lacing down the glass. SMELL: Pale malts, caramel notes, honeydew melon, some grapefruit and pine aromas on the nose. Well balanced. TASTE: Pale malts, caramel and melon flavors up front. Some grapefruit and pine bitterness at the swallow. Bold and lingering finish of piney bitterness, floral hops and a touch of caramel sweetness. Pretty decent, and more interesting than their pale ale. PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly dry. Full and creamy feel. OVERALL: This is pretty solid. A better and more interesting beer than their Augusta pale ale. There are quite a few good IPA's in Ontario now and while this one doesn't stand out, it can certainly run with the crowd. A solid IPA that I'd gladly drink on a regular basis. Cheers!  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.55
86645,IdeaSpeeder,2013-09-15,"   Serving Type - 473ml can, poured into a pint glass Appearance - A fine looking beer. Pours a clear Copper/orange in colour with a decent 2 fingers of thick white head which seems to be sticking around. A mild amount of carbonation is visible. No hop resin that I can see. Smell - Your standard I.P.A. fare here...citrus and pine in a big way. Malty smells...biscuit and caramel are also present. Taste - More of the same. Getting s caramel malts up front, followed by some decent citrus. Towards the end I'm getting mostly pine and a lingering bitterness, but given the style it's quite mild. Mouthfeel - Pretty light for an IPA. Carbonation is low as well. Beer finish wet and smooth.  ",4.75,4,4,3,4,3.95

86645,jrenihan,2013-08-08,"   Apparently this batch was the first unfiltered batch of the beer. Having not had it before, I can't say if there is a noticeable difference. Beer is toffee coloured with a moderately sized off-white head. Fades quickly. Bread and biscuit in the nose, a bit of orange-focused citrus. Taste is quite malty. Bread and caramel. The hops are there but are surprisingly muted. Some citrus and pine. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated. Bready. Overall. one of the maltiest IPAs I have ever had. Not something to go back to.  ",3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.54
86645,TerryW,2013-08-01,"   Good looking bright opaque rusty orange beer with a moderate head that settles to a film. Lots of lace all the way down. An extra 0.25 for fun graphics on the can. Nose full of grapefruit citrus and pine with malt lurking in the background. Taste is aggressively hoppy, dominated by citrus peel, followed by sweet malt, drying bitterness, slightly metallic. Decent enough, but essentially the same as the rest of the pack. As this style is becoming increasingly common its getting harder to distinguish yourself. Good overall and worth a try.  ",4.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.66
86645,spinrsx,2013-08-01,"   473ml Can from the Ottawa LCBO for $2.75 Appearance - Clear amber colour with a large size frothy beige coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some decent lacing. The head lasted for around 5 minutes before it was gone. Smell - Malts, caramel, grapefruit, hops Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, caramel and hops. There is also some grains and just a hint of a grapefruit flavour. It ends with a malty sweet mildly hopped aftertaste. Overall - While not exciting, this is a pretty decent beer. Don't expect anything American tasting as far as IPAs go.. more of a English style if anything, Not something I'd buy again, but worth trying once.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.53

47658,BucannonXC5,2018-06-15,"   Type: 750-ml. bottle Glass: AleSmith Barrel-Aged Reserve 10-oz. snifter From: Jubilation Wine & Spirits in Albuquerque, N.M. Price: $23.99 Purchased: May 4, 2018 Consumed: May 25, 2018 Reviewed as: American Double / Imperial Stout Misc.: 2017 release (no bottled on date); #CraftAdjace Saw cases of this at Jubilation Wine & Spirts in Albuquerque, N.M. Was excited because the allotment in San Diego sold out on the first day I believe and here there were loads and loads of it. Wasn’t happy with the $23.99 price tag, but it was at 750-ml. bottle and I reasoned with myself that it wasn’t available since Oct. 2011. Also from the same article saw that it was retailing for $24.99, so I guess I got a deal. Online description read, “Canadian Breakfast Stout (CBS) is the epitome of why we launched the Backstage Series: to bring some of our most sought-after beers, which have been available primarily at the taproom or at a few select events, to a much larger audience. Canadian Breakfast Stout is an Imperial Stout brewed with a blend of coffees and imported chocolates, then aged in spent bourbon barrels that have most recently been aging pure Michigan maple syrup.” DAMN! Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of khaki tan rocky head. Serene setting underneath with no noticeable bubbles. Almost perfect spiderweb foamy lacing. World-class retention. (Sight - 4.75) Smelled smooth bourbon, char wood, making it smokier than I would have thought, dark candied chocolate, cacao, oak, toffee, black burnt coffee grinds, light vanilla cream and maple syrup at the very end when I pulled away. Got straight maple from the bottle. Wow. What a difference from the glass that it was poured in and the bottle. (Smell - 4.25) Took a few sips to really appreciate it. In order got oaky bourbon, char wood, candied dark chocolate, cacao, espresso, burnt coffee grinds, lingering maple syrup, burnt brown sugar, vanilla cream, lightly toasted marshmallow, licorice, toffee and roasted barley. (Taste - 4.25) Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish, (Feel - 4.75) Just a terrific beer. Better than KBS for sure, although I still prefer most versions of Tioga-Sequoia to Founders. Hopefully this is the last time I ever purchase/review a #CraftAdjace beer.

47658,micada,2018-06-11,"   2017 bomber poured cellar temp to a chilled glass stein. Three finger tight mocha head that fades to a light tan top, mocha bottom ring that persists. Nose is smooth balance of bourbon, coffee, maple, maybe some vanilla. First sips follow the nose deliciously. This is my first encounter with this legend, and a very tasty one at that. The area had a surge of availability, so I bought four! Evidently, there are lots to go around, or the hype has faded, but I'm okay with being late to the party. Mouthfeel is heavy, full, lingering perfect balance of the core flavors. Very drinkable at a fast pace, but at $25 a bomber, savor that flavor! Lacing is still clinging to glass top some 20 minutes later. The aftertaste is sweet maple with a vanilla presence. In some ways, the front end reminds me of Prairie Paradise, which I was fortunate to score in my area recently, because some beer connoisseurs tucked away a handful. The sweetness was never cloying, unlike some ""dessert"" beers, but was balancing the dark roasted coffee and bourbon flavors. I didn't really get any prominent chocolate notes on nose or tongue. Does wanting only great beer like this make me a snob? I'm okay with that. I'll keep advocating (see what I did there?) for my friends to put down those sad, pale glasses of swill!  ",4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.69

Seriously though, the pint glass in front of me looks idyllic: a very deep but highly resplendent amber beer with a fine, almost peach-fuzz layer of foam atop. It's worthy of a magazine ad and requires no airbrushing. If you ask me, American hops and English yeast have always been uneasy bedfellows - one is vivid tropical and citrus fruits, the other is subtly suggestive of dark and dried fruits. They're coexistence is no less troubled in this bouquet; orange slices butt heads with raisins. The referee in all this is the malt, its toastiness and toffee notes complimentary to both the resinous pine taste as well as the subtler cherry-like notes. Malty flavours of caramel squares and sticky toffee pudding basically just take over outright on the palate (perhaps to the disappointment of anyone hoping for more focus on the pineapple and pine needles). The mouthfeel might be a bit cardboard-y if not for two factors: the grassiness and oiliness of the hops. These two textures - one dry and herbal, the other sappy and sticky - add a modest earthy dimension to a profile that otherwise would be dominated by plastic-y caramel. The bitterness is enough to sort the men from the boys but not the beasts from the men. Kensington Baldwin FishEye PA has echoes of modern, American-style hopping but is obviously of a more traditional, British-minded perspective. My experience tells me this will make it harder to sell as an ""IPA"" in the southern Ontario market; claiming it an English Strong Ale or something of the sort would serve it better... though it'd be a shame to waste such a good (bad) pun.  ",4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.63

S - Caramel, citrus, some pine, earthy. As it warms there's a slight metallic note in the background. T - Caramel, some toffee notes, citrus (grapefruit and some orange peel), earthy hops. Lots of bitterness but it's well balanced with the malts. The bitter aftertaste is short lived. M - Medium carbonation, medium-heavy body, mostly dry finish.

86645,GarthDanielson,2013-06-28,"   Poured from a tallboy into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark amber-copper coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, off-white head. Vibrant. Nose of pineapple and passion fruit sweetness, tangy caramel backbone, and floral highlights. Flavors of caramel on the forward tongue, roasted and slightly tangy, with a resiny, bitter hops streak at the end of the palate. Slick and slightly oily in mouth, with a roasty sweet aftertaste. Slick, slightly dry finish. Decent brew. A little all over the place, but tasty and interesting.  ",3.75,3.25,3.5,3,3.25,3.36

86645,andrenaline,2013-06-22,"   A pleasant find at the local LCBO... Surprising it made it this far north, but certainly glad it did. A - Pours a nice amber, finger of head with decent retention and some nicr sheeting lacing. S - Sweet citrus, earthy pine and cedar, caramel, toffee and a slight metallic finish. T - Follows the nose, sweet citrus, sugared grapefruit, earthy cedar and a touch of metallic notes. The finish is more bitter with mandarin rind and a touch of caramel. M - Medim bodied, smooth and surprisingly wet. O - A pleasant addition to the IPA selection locally and something I would both recommend and grab more of. Easily sessioned and well worth picking up. Here's to hoping they stock this regularly.  ",4,3.75,3.75,4,4,3.84
86645,thehyperduck,2013-06-21,"   473 mL can from the LCBO; no freshness info - but that's not terribly concerning because these haven't been on the shelves for very long. It's encouraging to see another beer from the folks that brought us Augusta Ale - not exactly a personal favourite of mine, but still a good beer that I've returned to on multiple occasions. I haven't had an IPA in a few months now, so hopefully this one will satiate my hop addiction. Served slightly chilled, and poured into a pint glass. This brew pours a beautiful amber colour, slightly hazy and topped with about one finger of puffy, off-white head that quickly recedes into a thin, creamy film. It also leaves a solid ring of thick lacing behind, coating the sides of the glass. Enjoyable aroma that doesn't stray far from the mean - pine sap and orange citrus notes, with some bready malts and caramel detectable just beneath the hoppy surface. Enticing enough so far, I suppose, but the taste leaves me wanting. The malts are more profound here than on the nose, providing a pleasant caramel sweetness that underlies the far more noticeable hop bill. Earthy pine needles, pink grapefruit and orange pith become more prominent toward the finish, which is fairly astringent and bitter. Medium-bodied with mild carbonation, and an oily feel that makes this brew's aftertaste cling to the tongue after each sip, extending its presence. This is a well-made beer that I don't have any real complaints about, other than the fact that it offers nothing particularly novel or exciting. I had a hop craving and this brew stood up to the task nicely, but while drinking it I discovered no features that really stood out. I'm a big fan of the mouthfeel, though, which really makes this stuff seem more drinkable than it probably should be at 6.5%. Final Grade: 3.72, a serviceable B grade. Like Augusta Ale, Kensington's Baldwin Fisheye PA is a solid representative of its style, but I'd hesitate to call it an outstanding one. It's not a bad beer - quite the opposite, in fact. It's a textbook American IPA that I wouldn't hesitate to suggest to someone looking for a good baseline introduction to the style. Worth a shot. [Updated Jan. 4 2014] Another can, this time compared side-by-side with Mad Tom, Boneshaker and Red Racer IPA. I've had a few cans of this over the past few weeks and have come to appreciate it a little more - this is not an attention-grabbing IPA at all, but it's quite tasty, well-balanced and sessionable for the style. Good stuff, and something I'll probably return to again.  ",3.75,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.72

314675,GratefulBeerGuy,2018-02-11,"   PKG on 1/8/18 opened on 2/11/18 A burnt amber color, brown highlights, murky liquid. Bubbly and dense, creamy foam cover. 2"" high, very slow to recede. A bit of lacing. Very fruity, minty scented hops pop right out. Pineaaple and orange and spice. Dank scented hops with a big spice kick in the nose. More of a malty style aroma than the New England style has. It's got that maltier, rich-amber effect going on. Pretty bold nose. Smokey caramel and big dry earthy hops hit your palate first in both mouthfeel and flavor. The malty tones lead to a medium to full bodied feel, with heavy layers of earthy-leafy, and grainy malt effects. They keep eachother in check , as both the malt charecter and high-alpha style hops blend together. Eventhough the malt flavor is slightly bigger than any of the lighter malted New England style's, the body and effect is still pretty juicy, the hops dry kick soon becomes a bit juicy and fruity toward the end. A bitter, leafy and practically sour hop kick finishes it off. I'm beginning to realize this is a very well roundee DIPA with a bit of West coast and East coast stylings. The ""almost"" 9 % abv adds a heat tingle and boozy aspect which combined with higher alpha, bitter hops equals a very ""in your face"" approach. Bludgeon is a very appropriate name for this DIPA.  ",3.75,4.5,4,4.25,4,4.13

The hops are a bit subdued for the style but a nice mix of orange, earth, and malt. Medium bodied with a chewy, tacky mouthfeel. The palate features a balance of malt, pine, citrus, and bitterness. Finishes a bit sweet with a lingering, piney bitterness and chewy malt. Fairly decent old-school west coast rendition but needs more hops in the nose.  ",4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,4.17
314675,SawDog505,2017-11-29,"   Poured into a 16 oz KBS Snulip glass, not sure when it was canned but recent the last 3 weeks. Pours a cloudy dark orange with a massive 2 plus finger sticky white head, that leaves a wall of lace as it slowly settles into a thin layer and ring of bubbles around the sides of the glass. Smell is apricot, papaya, tangerine, hard orange candy, pine, and grapefruit rind. Taste follows apricot, papaya, tangerine, pine, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is about large, with plenty of life, maybe a little dry, and drinks easy enough for its size. Overall this is a very nice NEDIPA, that is is pretty darn chewy and surprisingly approachable. Well done.  ",4.5,4,4,4.5,4.25,4.13

Rich sticky lacing left behind at each level. Smell: Spices definitely stand out on the front with big accents of peppercorns, cinnamon, pepper, and acorns. There is a fresh squeeze citrus touch underneath those spices which really pops. A touch of bready malt with some bright yeast comes through on the back end. Taste: Citrus notes immediately blitz the palate. Fresh squeezed lime and lemon really shine. Earthy and grounded spices balance out that citrus forward front. Spices continue to linger as they join forces with a bready, biscuity body that remind you this is certainly a wit. Finish is lingering spices with medium bodied fruits. Mouthfeel: This is some world class drinkability. You get the full impact of the spices without weighing down the mouthfeel. Added citrus adds a crispness on the mouthfeel which makes this brew go down way to quickly. Overall: Another wonderfully crafted brew from Door County Brewing. Everything I've had from these folks has been absolutely on point. This beer is outstandingly drinkable with spice and citrus notes. Some of the witbier characteristics get a touch lost but thats really nitpicking.  ",3.75,4,4,4.75,4.25,4.11

278082,ichorNet,2017-05-04,"   I've been a fan of Rising Tide for quite a while at this point, probably nearing on 5 years or so... jeez, where does time go? So, yeah, whenever I see a new release by them, I typically give it a shot without even thinking about it... they're very trustworthy and have an excellent taproom in Portland, ME to boot! This is an experimental hop series, something that's kinda all-the-rage these days. Playing with different hop profiles and lupulin flavors/aromas is fun for brewers and usually the end result is something I can at least appreciate and think about on a beer-judgment level. This one utilizes Mosaic, Simcoe and Azacca hops. The pour on this is somewhat hazy, and medium-yellow/gold in color. Very, very fine particulate floats suspended throughout the body, and the head here ends up really nice and compact after an initial huge showing. Lace is spectacular as well. Quite nice looking if you don't mind the hop haze. I, for one, do not, so this is a big win for me! Nose is interesting, for sure. Mango and papaya up front with some candied melon, pine sap and spruce. The pine mingling with the tropical elements is interesting as they kind of mesh together amorphously instead of being clearly delineated up front. I feel like, more often than not, the heady evergreen notes of Simcoe punch through the tropical and citrusy/melon character of Azacca/Mosaic. If you like Simcoe-forward notes in your IPA, this will work for you. Flavor is along the same line with some slightly juicier fruit notes toward the mid-palate. Fruit gum, papaya, pineapple and even apricot come across on the tongue alongside a crisp and easygoing malt backbone. Slightly prickly bitterness toward the finish with more pine and spruce from Simcoe. Slight grapefruit rind and light melon in the aftertaste. Maybe even a bit floral at times to my tastebuds. Feel is slick, oily and quite lean with a rather easily-drinkable stature. My cans don't have a listed ABV, but it's probably 5.9% like the other batches have been considering I doubt the grain bill really changes at all. At 5.9%, this is pretty much right in line with other 6%-ish IPAs in terms of body. Just enough to feel like more than a hoppy pale ale but less than an imperial. Alcohol is not really noticeable as bitterness and characterful hops wash it out. Nice stuff here, glad to check it out!  ",4.75,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.31

My first impression was that it a bit to casked and did not have traditional beer qualities but in hindsight, that is exactly wha makes this beer so unique. It has a very notable cask musk odor and an understated carbonation, almost seems flat but the carbonation is very fine and the small bubbles helps keep this smooth. If you like Rye Whiskey and you like beer, you'll find this a pleasant combination of both. Has an almost cocktail quality without the watered down addition of ice. Beware though, this beer is not for someone looking for a straight up beer. This is a nice night cap type beer. Drink one and you're feeling quite good. Drink two and you better have a designated driver.  ",3.25,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.28

83830,Alieniloquium,2013-06-04,   12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Appearance - Clear amber body. Wispy surface. Smell - Slightly fruity. A lot of caramel. A little estery. Clovey and some banana. Taste - More fruit. Drier caramel. Earthy hops in the back. Musty finish. Mouthfeel - Dry with just a hint of bitterness. No booze and medium low carbonation. Overall - Decent just not very interesting.  ,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.29

97227,BeerFMAndy,2013-10-17,"   12 oz bottle poured into a Bruery tulip. Cryyy little sister! (Thou shall not falll) -ok, had to get that out there. A - Swirled half way through the pour, the bottle's sediment clouds the golden wheat colored beer considerably and capping it with plush white foam! S - Little Sister's got it where it counts at the most basic level; wheat, citrus, spice, and classic yeast aroma but, shift gears and dive into it's complexity! Heavy coriander seed and notes of cardamom, as well as sweet orange peel suggest spice and citrus are added, not just influenced by the yeast but esters of lemongrass and white pepper peek out from behind the relaxed floral hop notes. T - Forcefully spicy at first, Little Sister approaches being overdone but hits the breaks just in time. Coriander and cardamom flourish from the front to the back, through the whole ride, with bright orange peel citrus and flirtatious floral hop notes deviating from the spice path, nicely balancing it out. M - Effervescent and lighter bodied, Little Sister is spicy up front, dry on the finish but smooth from wheat the whole way through for a well-balanced and refreshing take on a wit! O - As one of two launch beers for Door County, Little Sister might be a pretty easy drinking witbier but, it's bold aroma and flavors make it anything but introductory. Heavy-handed but purposeful and distinctive, Door County Brewing Co. distances themselves from modest witbiers that feature reserved adjunct additions. And they do a damn good job at it.  ",4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.1

97227,emerge077,2013-07-29,"   Murky golden orange, soapy white foam on the surface, spotty dish bubble soap lacing around the edges of the glass. Poured the yeast and it just hangs in suspension in a wispy flame shape. Aroma is heavy on coriander, a little bit of floral soap. Taste has a hint of sweetness at first, becoming dry in the middle. Creamy wheaty feel, smooth and light to medium bodied. A slight medicinal taste, not sure what that's attributed to, maybe grains of paradise. Easily drinkable, bought a six pack and down to my last one. Overall pretty good first contract-brew effort from this new brewery, hopefully they get into more creative stuff in the future.  ",4,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,3.63

83830,Brabander,2013-04-28,"   I got this beer from my dear beerbuddy Robert (Torino). Thanks Robert. Poured this one in my De Molen tasting glass. Nice golden yellow fluid. Got some heavy pouring to do to get some head. Very light carbonation, little lacing. Floral smell far away with some anice hints. Good mouthfeel. A decent drinkable beer but not too spectacular. The alcohol is pretty well hidden.  ",3.25,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.55
83830,rhoadsrage,2013-04-25,   (Served in a teku) A- This beer pours a hazy dark orange body with a thick ring of bubbly beige and a very faint pfsst hint is all that was heard when I twisted the cap off. S- The woody caramel aroma has a slight sweet wort note to it with a sweet ester sugar note in the finish. The aroma is very light but also quite mysterious. T- The slightly dry caramel turns to a sweet candy hint. There is some wet wood oxidation taste and some slight tartness in the finish. A light citrus juice note comes through in the aftertaste. There is an alcohol taste that grows and cuts the sweetness quite a bit as it opens up. M- This beer has a medium-light mouthfeel with a full alcohol warmth and a fizz in the finish that gives a fullness texture without being fizzy. O- This has some characteristics of a miabock and hints of a light barleywine with a soft sweetness and a full alcohol. The flavor and aroma were both pretty soft and I just couldn’t get behind this beer. There were moments it was tasty and then it was more odd characters like the oxidation or the tartness or citrus that outweighed the tasty. Thanks to Thickfreakness for sending to me it was fun to try.  ,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.67

Tastes of grapefruit and very deep roasted malts (with some sweetness up-front). Almost full-bodied, smooth, and with mild carbonation. Tasty and nice to drink; not bad, but probably my least favorite black IPA that I've tried.  ",4,3.5,4,4,4,3.88

125646,MikeyMcD86,2016-12-22,"   Drank the day I brought it home from the brewery out of a TEKU. The line at the brewery was stupid long. Look: As the name suggests, this beer has a full full haze, deep bright golden color and half a finger of fluffy white head. Aroma: Classic TH! Big creamsicle aroma along tons of candied citrus, passionfruit and pineapple. Taste: Aroma translates to the palate. A little more green on palate than the nose would suggest. Definitely a strong pithy bitterness as well balances the strong up front candied flavors. Finishes with a good amount of hop burn though, the only flaw in this beer. Mouthfeel: Super crushable for 8.2%. the strong bitter hop burn slices through that thick treehouse creaminess. Overall(style points): Another amazing IPA from Treehouse. Killer nose that's on par w/Julius but the strong bitter finish slots it behind Julius making this my second favorite beer from them. 99.25 points!  ",5,5,5,5,5,5

47658,Mmcpartlon,2018-05-06,"   Bottled at the tail end of 2017. Never given this high of a rating before. This beer was insane. The taste, look and smell notes are basically the same as what others have described. I will add that the batch I tried did not have a lot of maple syrup in the nose, and the maple sweetness was extremely faint, popping up mainly at the finish. The thing that got me with this beer was it’s body. Never had a barrel aged stout that was even close to being this smooth, especially at 12%ABV. The beer is definitely full bodied, but somehow it felt extremely light and fluffy, sort of like drinking a bourbon-maple-stout storm cloud. It was unbelievable. For such a flavorful beer there was no one taste that overpowered. I personally feel that this beer was worth every bit of hype it’s received. Would definitely wait in a very long line for it.  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.78

Coffee, chocolate syrup, roasted malts, espresso, earth, notes of leather and maybe a hint of vanilla as well. The taste isn’t as sweet as I expected. Bourbon taste is upfront but the maple syrup and sweetness from the chocolate are not over powering. Woody with cocoa and black coffee. Roasted malts, leather and earth towards the end. Woody, Bourbon finish with one last hint of maple syrup. Medium to heavy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Not quite as boozey tasting as I had expected but it does have a noticeable alcohol presence.

47658,arizcards,2018-04-21,"   Stood in line for an hour at the Craft Beer Hop Stop on 12-5-2017 and picked up a 750ml bottle for $24.99. Bottled likely in November 2017 (no bottling date visible). Beer poured black as night with a very nice tan head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is a awesome combination of coffee, cocoa, bourbon, and maple; it is very subtle yet wonderful! Taste is a masterful blend of coffee, chocolate, subtle maple, and a nice touch of bourbon. Initial sips were warming to let you know the bourbon was there, yet a beautiful compliment to the entire flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, so velvety smooth across the palate with each sip. Overall this brew lives up to the hype. I honestly thought i would not like it a lot because i am not big on maple but i have to say i am totally impressed!  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.68

47658,familyguy2010,2018-04-15,"   Shared with friends around a fire. I know - heresy! But I had purchased it over the holidays and wanted to share with friends, and had forgotten about it for a few months. Perhaps I should have left it shelved for longer. Look - is very dark and thick looking pouring out into tasting cups. Smell is very sweet, yes on the border of cloying. Maple syrup, chocolate, coffee. I thought at that point ""oh no, is this like those sickly sweet holiday stouts?"" Taste is very very very sweet, I would counter and say on the wrong side of too sweet. Maple, chocolate, some hint of coffee (weak) and then hard to discern much else, but I suspect some vanilla was present to try and calm it down, but at the expense of more sweetness. Cloyingly sweet. Mouthfeel was fine and unoffensive, but it did feel like drinking watered down syrup. Overall, this disappointed me at the cost of $28 bottle and for a beer ranked #13 on this site. I admit I ""am"" some BMCer posting only my third review, and I have been swayed to the East Coast juice bomb IPAs for the last couple years, but I drink Guinness, Founders Porter, and other darks on occasion, and was expecting something more subtly balanced and much much less sweet. I may re-evaluate after exploring more stouts, but this was more like a dessert than a beer. I will say that it smelled delicious and made us all hungry for pancakes as we doused the fire with the remainder at end of night. Can't say we weren't warned, it did say ""breakfast"" right there on the label. Mea Culpa!  ",4,2.75,2,4,3,2.7

Taste is massive and sweet, but again on the right side of too sweet. Maple syrup, bourbon, oak and vanilla assault your taste buds. More chocolate appear as it warms. Superb. Mouthfeel is perfect, thick and sticky with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall, this managed to live up to my hype. One of the best stouts I've ever had.  ",4.5,4.75,5,5,4.75,4.86
47658,ATXBrew,2018-04-14,"   10oz draft pour from Whichcraft North in Austin,TX compared side by side with a draft KBS. The KBS was so good that I didn’t think I could identify any flaws with it until I took my first sip of CBS. Both beers are incredible but I would give the edge to the CBS. The additional sweetness from the maple helps to mask any remaining alcohol flavors that survived the chocolate and coffee infusion. There is no trace of its double digit ABV. The CBS is smooth, sweet, silky, deliciousness and a must try for any BA fan.  ",5,4.75,5,5,5,4.94

47658,hopflyer,2018-04-09,"   2017 release. Pours nearly full black, 2 finger dark tan head. Barrel smell with chocolate and faint coffee. Roasty. Not much maple. First sip carries coffee bitterness, powder cocoa and a bit of booze. Continues with faint sweetness from the syrup sugar. Bitterness fades and opens up some more semi sweet chocolate. Vanilla as it warms some with background sweetness throughout. Medium to big bodied, more carbonation than I was expecting. Full mouth coating and long finish. This definitely is more complex than KBS, but not as much as I expected. It is sweeter from the maple but it's much subdued by coffee and bakers chocolate bitterness. Body seems right for the ABV and the flavors hold back any real booziness.  ",4.75,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.56

83830,jlindros,2013-04-22,"   Also thanks to thanks to ApostleBrewing as well as dcloeren for this one as I just had a Jester King beer that came from them as well, coincidence. Pours a decent fizzy almost 1 finger head, not bad for 10% abv, fades at a med pace with little lacing, hazy, slight suspended particulate, amber nectar orange color. Nose starts like candy, butterscotch toffee, slight peanut brittle, candy syrup, sweet malty, reddish malts, hint of clean booze, light fruity touch as well, not much else though. Taste starts with more candy, sweet slightly syrupy candy, light toffee and brittle, light apple fruit and candy apple flavor. Booze cuts in and let's you know with warming tingly booze but clean, some nutty caramel with the syrupy sweetness, rich buttery toffee comes out more on the back end. Finish is semi syrupy sticky with an anesthetizing booze feel, lingering nutty and buttery toffee, caramel, just a touch of earthy bitterness even slight creamy caramel and creamed honey. Mouth is med to fuller bodied, plenty of warming tingly booze, decent carb. Overall not bad, but nothing special. It's more like a big candy beer than anything, with the sticky sweetness, syrupy flavors, lots of toffee and brittle like flavors, pretty sweet as expected. Not much for the nice malty flavors though, esp aged soft malt characters I expect in a good old ale, but otherwise not too bad.  ",4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.79

The hops have faded on this, leaving behind a boquet of caramel and malt notes. It’s stickly piney, with a sweet finish. The flavor is fairly mellow, with a rounded piney resin, and some light toasted coconut and almond notes. The body holds up, and it warms well enough to savor for a spell. Certainly the Divine Reserve series is a high point of the St. Arnold stable and this does not disappoint.  ",4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.19

80009,MasterSki,2012-04-06,"   Served in a tulip from the hand-pump at Fountainhead. A - Quick-dissolving white foam settles to a thin collar and a few spots of lace. Lightly hazed pale yellow body. S - Initially I thought this smelled a lot like Gossamer - I was actually suspicious I had received the regular beer and not the special cask variant. However, letting it sit for a moment and warm up revealed tropical and earthy brettanomyces notes. Still, the main flavors were those of Gossamer's sweet malt backbone and potent dry-hopping. As it warms up there's an odd vegetal note, but it didn't seem much like prickly pear flesh - perhaps they used the whole fruit in the cask? T - Less overt hop character, with more sweet malts mid-palate as well as some lightly toasted grain. Finishes with a mildly funky and slightly medicinal brett note. Still, it's largely Gossamer in character. M - Smooth body, dry and mildly tannic fruit husk texture, lower cask-style carbonation, and some dryness in the finish. D - Easy to drink, but a fairly tepid attempt at a wild. The aggressive dry-hop character seems at odds with the wild elements of the beer, and the use of prickly pear cactus doesn't add much depth. The aroma actually reminded me a little of the infected can of AXL Pale Ale, but this tasted much better. Not a bad attempt by Half Acre - was the brett added directly to the cask? Perhaps it needs a bit more time to work (and for the hops to dissipate).  ",4,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.68

Cloudy, bright golden color with a creamy/frothy bright white head on top that hangs around for quite a while. A few whisps of lace were left behind. S: Really kinda mild. A faint amount of hops mixed with a a faint amount of fruit. Became a little more assertive as it came up to temp. T: See above but the taste hits the ground running a little faster than the smell. Obviously Brett-y. M: Dry and spicy with a long lasting prickly finish. O: Pretty cool experiment. I got there at 4pm and actually got the first glass out of the firkin. A little too cold for my liking at first, but it didn't take very long to warm up. I'd love to see how this opens up and changes after a few hours of getting air at it.  ",4.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.91

Super hoppy forward flavors, with peppery highlights and a bitter coffee backbone that lasts through the aftertaste. Robust and a little dry on the body, with a bitter finish. Very tasty!  ",4.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.98
61562,Eriktheipaman,2011-04-08,   Poured the blackest of black with one finger tan head. Smelt of slightly of fresh fruity hops. The taste was more roasty than what I expected. At first you get chocolate and roasted coffee then on the back you get the standard bitterness of an IPA. I would think it would be the other way around but it surly is not. A pretty good beer and I love the Cascadian style but this is probably on the lower end of the ones Ive tried. I would order it again however because it does have pretty good drink-ability.  ,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.83

61562,dwilson01,2010-09-03,"   In a mug at the brewery earlier tonite (not a fan of remote reviews but this is a new one so I made an exception). It's not really a strong ale, it's a black IPA but there is no category for that yet. The body is dark, more black than brown, thick and topped with a dark mocha colored head. About a finger's worth on it initially which dissipates to a sploty thin film which remains throughout. The smell is floral hops initially, a refreshing scent which perks up the nostrils, this is followed by a smoked malty sweet type tinge. The flavor profile is very interesting. First I got the smoked malt which gave me a bacon taste which was very intense. This was followed by an indistinguishable malty flavor, kind if a sweet molasses and dark biscuit combined into one. The hops come more towards the end and are very subtle but leave you with a great balanced aftertaste which I enjoyed. The mouthfeel is great, it's super malty so it's thick creamy and smooth as well as having a lightening sense from the hoppy aftertaste. For sure a sipping brew, I am not 100% on the abv but I would guess between the 8 and 9 percent range.  ",4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.81

Nose is a nice citrus forward aroma, again hitting the style. Taste is a very nice combination of mango, grapefruit, and orange over an oat and barley malt base. Flavors really popped when sipping while enjoying the PAB burger. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied and refreshing.

There is a thin white head that dissipates pretty quickly and doesn't lace very much. The color on this old ale is pretty different from any other I've had. S: It's you regular ""old ale"" scent, but a bit lighter. There is some malty sweetness, a little bit of hoppiness, but very little of the dark fruit type flavors you'd expect from your average old ale. T: It tastes a lot darker than it looks; the taste is almost your average old ale, but a bit lighter and a bit easier to drink. It is almost like an ""old ale light,"" and brings a much more easily downable taste to the old ale canon. M: Thin, but not too thin, and smooth. The carbonation is pretty light, as you should expect from an old ale, and the bubbles are pretty mild. D: It goes down easy, amybe TOO easy for a 10% ABV beer. This one could get people in a lot of trouble. I see the DR#12 as a great way to get friends that are into milder beers introduced to the old ale genre of beer, and follow it up with something heavier like a Curmudgeon.  ",3,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.97

80942,elNopalero,2012-05-03,"   This is a historic Polish style-session beer made with oak smoked wheat. Too curiosity provoking to pass up! It poured a cloudy golden color with tightly laced foam atop. It had a light, barely perceptible smoke aroma to it. The light smokiness carries over to the flavor with a surprising tartness. It’s lemony and crisp with a wheated smoothness. Overall just an interesting, complexly flavored, curious beer. Surprisingly filling too—its effervescence which kept it light also unexpectedly inflated my belly! In some ways it reminds me of a Berliner weiss (a la Bell’s Oarsman) with a similar tart/lactic souring and light/crisp/refreshing flavor, not to mention the low ABV—and minus the smoke nuances, of course. Love it or hate it I imagine you’ll find this brew hard to forget.  ",,,,,,4.4

47658,scotorum,2018-04-07,"   FOUNDERS CBS 4/6/18 a: Opaque black with an enormous five inch tan head which receded slowly to thick even surface foam and very dense lacing. s; Primarily roasty malt with some alcohol notes. t: Follows the nose with additional fairly prominent maple syrup flavor. Mainly sweet finish, high ABV quite well covered, with virtually no throat burn. m: Silky medium to full, great body and some carbonation tingle. o; Definitely a superlative brew loaded with pleasing flavor. However most of us can't afford to drink this too often at $15 per 12 ounce glass.  ",5,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.65
47658,mvanaskie13,2018-04-07,"   Christmas present from my brother that I finally decided to open... Poured into a small chalice: color is solid black with tan head of fine bubbles, presents at least 1 inch thick and lingers really, really well. Good spotty lacing on the glass sides. Smell is probably the most subdued aspect, even after 20-30 minutes of warming: aroma is sweet, light roast, hint of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate. Not much coffee, especially compared to base breakfast stout. Taste is somewhat ridiculous - hard to fathom that this is a 12% abv brew, but i think the maple/bourbon barrel aging really softens the booziness. Flavor is sweeter than expected, but not cloying, good base stout with vanilla, bourbon, chocolate interplaying well. No coffee like notes. Still a beer that is too easy drinking at 12%. Mouthfeel is where the booziness comes into play, but still not detracting from the beers character - you expect it. Feel starts sweet, with moderate/low carbonation, good presence. Overall a great brew that hides its strength and is too easy to drink.  ",4.5,4,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.48

47658,matthewp,2018-04-04,"   This beer certainly didn't live up to the hype for me. Its not a bad beer but it was overly sweet for me. Comparing it to Clown Shoes Snow On the Maple Tree, which is also aged in bourbon barrels that had maple syrup previously in them, I'd give the nod to Clown Shoes. The Clown Shoes beer is also nearly half the price of CBS. Taking cost out of the equation I'd still pick Clown Shoes simply because the sweetness was balanced with the bourbon notes. If you like sweet stouts this is a good option, if you want a bit more bourbon bite it won't hit the mark.  ",4.75,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.43

47658,Jtee,2018-04-02,"   Celebrating my recently achieved Cicerone CBS and my 100th review on BeerAdvocate with CBS. From a 355ml bottle served chilled at 11 degrees Celsius into a TeKu glass. Best before date: 27.10.2018 – I've had the bottle since December 2017. My expectations are sky-high given the hype around this beer. I also may have had it on tap during its December release. Yup, most definitely did. Look: The beer pours an opaque black with 4.5cm of dense, mousse-like, brown head that dissipates into a partial film within 5+ minutes. Exceptional lacing with some of the most persistent head I've seen for a near 12% ABV beer. World-class. Smell: Medium-strong and balanced. Rich, deep, and layered. A staggering malt complexity with moderate vanilla and oak. Prominent notes of chocolate and coffee with a roasty character that surprises you every now and then. A well-hidden ethanol along with some licorice and caramel also come up. The dry nose is oaky-caramelly. For such a robust beer this shows an impressive amount of restraint. No apparent hop or yeast aroma. Taste: Follows the aroma with strong intensity, bitter balance, and assertive perceived bitterness. Big, bold, and absolutely delicious. The gorgeous flavour opens up with chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and some bourbon. Moving towards mid-palate, notes of coffee begin to take over along with a sweetness that I assume comes from the maple syrup. Additional notes include dried fruit (prunes) along with black licorice and the faintest of ethanol right before the aftertaste settles in. The long finish is strong and bitter with lingering notes of bourbon and chocolate. Simply delish. Feel: Full body with mild carbonation. Thick, velvety-smooth, and creamy with great chewy, viscosity. Smooth and balanced alcohol warming of moderate strength. No harshness or astringency even with the strong bitterness. Overall: Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout is a wonderful, world-class beer featuring excellent craftsmanship and low drinkability. Robust, full of layers, and most of all balanced. It's rare to find a barrel-aged beer with such grace. I do prefer the KBS for the lack of sweetness that the maple syrup brings in. A must-try in my books.  ",5,4.75,5,5,5,4.94
47658,ryan1788a5,2018-04-01,"   750ml bottle poured into a snifter. A: Inky black with a creamy brown head. Half a finger of retention. Spotty lacing. S: Freshly brewed pot of coffee, roasty, maple syrup, dark chocolate. Perhaps the faintest whiff of green hops. Slight oakiness, bourbon is barely perceptible if at all. Well put together. Smells like breakfast in a glass. T: Fresh coffee, maple syrup, dark and semi-sweet chocolates. Plenty of malt roast and caramel. The barrel itself is rather subdued, with a faint corny-sweet bourbon flavor and warmth and a dab of oak. It manifests itself a bit more into the finish, where just a bit of char is evident as well. M: Rich, thick, and sticky. Very chewy. Carbonation is apparent, but has a soft touch. Creamy and decadent. O: Damn good stuff. Strikes a perfect balance. Coffee, chocolate, and maple syrup meld perfectly with the base beer. The syrup flavors are 90% of what the barrel has to offer, though there are some bourbon and oak subtleties too. It is big and sticky in texture and feel, but as far as the alcohol goes only a faint warmth belies its strength. It's easy to see why this became such a coveted beer.  ",4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.4

47658,JacobusFavier23,2018-04-01,"   I had this beer a few days ago and I had to sit on it for a while before giving it's score. This beer is absolutely fantastic through and through. Wonderful dark dark brown with an almost chocolate colored head savory head. Powerfully strong aromas of chocolate, dark fruit, roasted Carmel, vanilla, sugar can, brown sugar, roasted nuts, roasted oats, chocolate, coffee, toffee and of course, lots and lots of maple. The flavor is pretty much the same. It tastes as powerful as it smells and it is truly delicious. The mouthfeel is very juicy and rewarding as well. But I have one problem with this beer. It seems to try and stand on its own, but in reality it is literally KBS with maple. I understand how well crafted and special this beer is, but without the maple it is KBS. With that being said, this beer's maple flavor isn't exactly a step forward in the breakfast stout from founders. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it doesn't have a quality that makes it better than KBS. I really love the maple flavor in this beer, but in reality, KBS is better because it doesn't have that maple flavor. Again, great beer that is extremely well crafted and delicious. But it's just KBS with the flavor of Maple. I understand the hype and I would try it if I were you, but the similarity is just too close and KBS did it before so it's the better beer to me.  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.68

Pleased to be 7th review of Lawn Dart. a) Totally Euro in look, aroma and taste. Straw gold with steep head that slacks to a ring of suds and dotty lace. s) Lots of grain, biscuit malt and continental hops. Smells like Luxembourg. t) Follows smell, more white crackers, with good lemony crisp astringency and euro style bitter hops. f) Thin, cleansing, bright, and crisp. Good first beer, aperitif. o) All Pilsners are too similar to tease a part. This one falls a bit for being a bit too yeasty, crackery, grainy, but otherwise refreshing.  ",3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.68

65294,JizackFH,2011-01-14,"   Had on cask at Bierkraft in Brooklyn, NY tonight. A - This beer pours a very nice mahogany ruby color, and it has very small off-white head. The head left some specs of lacing on the glass. It also has a nice clarity to it. S - It smells of sweet caramel malts, hops, and cedar. There are also some notes of dark fruits present. T - I am getting some smooth caramel sweetness at first. Almost as soon as the sweetness hits, I got an assault of bitter hoppiness attacking my taste buds in a wonderful way. There are nice cedar notes here as well as some brown sugar. M - This has a very smooth and creamy feel to it. It has a medium body with medium-low carbonation. There is an extreme puckering hop bitterness here that I find wonderful. The bitterness lingers in the mouth for quite some time. D - The drinkability is good. I really like this beer. It is smooth, creamy, and it goes down easy. The flavor is great as well. Overall, this is a really good beer, and I'm glad I got the chance to try it, since I think its pretty limited. I recommend trying this is you ever come across it.  ",,,,,,4.45
290002,smcolw,2017-07-04,"   Darker gold, unusual for a ""Blonde"". Clear. Little head which leaves only a few spots for lace. There's a burnt wood element to the initial smell. Darker (than Blonde) malt aromas. Too much of a macro malt taste despite the ""pilsner and Munich malt"" description. Dry with a bit of an ashen flavor. The body and carbonation are appropriate for the style.  ",,,,,,3.53

138468,Erikshegda1994,2017-06-12,"   Look - Black and thick with a small mocha colored head, slight lacing Smell - Coffee, malt, raison/dried fruit Taste - Coffee with sweet caramel flavor and notes of chocolate and some raison/dried fruit flavor - well balanced Feel - Too much carbonation for my liking, takes away from the beer a little bit but still thick and full bodied Overall an exceptional imperial stout and I highly recommend drinking along side either a bourbon or a light irish style stout such as guiness or any stout that tastes like an iced coffee. This will enhance the flavors of this beer and make it superb as well as enhance the flavors of the bourbon. I paired with Vault's Coffee Stout and a couple average priced bourbons that ended up tasting amazing.  ",4.75,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,4.36

47658,kemoarps,2018-03-25,"   2017 Release Pours a deep stout-brown with no light penetration. Soapy dark brown head settles into a ring and a dusting of fuzz. Good lacing. Right off the bat it's big sweet notes of barrel and coffee and chocolate. Vanilla and oak. Black coffee. Almost a cinnamon-spicy element that's probably more barrel, but gave a spice hint for a second. I'm not really getting any maple, but my sniffer is notoriously weak, so *shrug* Oh man... First thought: this is a damn good beer. Second thought: this is a damn sweet beer. Third thought: but this is a damn good beer! Sugar maple is the first thing that makes its presence known. I know I said I didn't smell it, but it is absolutely there in the taste and it is delicious. I love maple, though. As it warms, the maple moves from the big splash at the first impression to more of the build and a supportive role. OK. So sweet maple, like the crust that builds at the lip of your jug of maple syrup. That's what the first impressions are. In support of this sweet crust is a balance of acrid black coffee and rich hints of dark chocolate and char. The vanilla and oak of the barrel gets folded in as the grout between the sweet maple syrup and richness of the dark chocolate. Finish leans more heavily into the fudgy rich chocolate before lingering with a bitter dark chocolate finish. Body could stand to be a touch heftier, per my personal preference (I admit I'm a sucker for those stouts that are like used motor oil). Fine pinpricks of carbonation help usher the tongue along between the various notes listed above. I'm not surprised that it is 11.7% ABV per se, but it is very well folded in with the rest of the brew and does not taste 'hot' like many big big stouts like this can. This is a beer with an incredible reputation, and I'm glad to finally confirm it for myself. Much much love to @FlintB for sending this along for NBS BIF#007. This was one of the first beers that I listed after that I couldn't get locally, and here almost seven years later I'm finally getting to try it thanks to Brian's generosity. I think it's likely to stay as a permawant.  ",4.5,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.75,4.57

Aromas of lots o’ coffee, malt, chocolate, maple, light bourbon, vanilla, cocoa. Smells divine. The taste also starts with strong coffee, then malt, chocolate, vanilla, maple, some bourbon. Smooth, a solid full, well carbonated. Way more coffee than I expected, a little less bourbon, too. The chocolate also stands out, the maple is solid, and even if less than I thought, the bourbon sneaks up on you. Certainly a great beer.  ",4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.56

47658,Bierman9,2018-03-18,"   Was up in Waterbury VT on 24FEB18 with Alewife and stopped into Craft Beer Cellar. Spotted about 15 of this beer on the shelves, so I had to swoop in. The 750ml bottle set me back $24.95. Diving into it today, a sunny, cold, lazy winters day (18MAR18). Poured about half into a small snifter to start... It is an oily, dense, black brew, with a fine, creamy but thin beige head. Lacing is pretty decent, overall. The aroma is rich with dark choco, mocha, some maple and a hint of coffee. The feel is easily medium-plus, bordering on being full and chewy. And it is smooth and silky all the way across the tongue. Flavor has a lovely mix of various items... There's dark choco, but it's rather sweet and not bitter at all. Then some mocha and cocoa, plus subtle coffee notes. Sweet maple syrup action lingers lovingly on the palate, along with some bourbon lurking in the background. Being such a chocolaty malt bomb, the hopping is rather light and barely noticeable. This one is going down quite easily, and my innards can feel the warmth . Not sure I'd shell out that kind of coin again, but I'm glad I was able to get to try this one.... I think I picked a good one for my 2000th BA review... Prosit!! 4.53/5 rDev -2.8% look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5 2000  ",4.25,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.53

Pours black with a thick 1 inch medium brown head Nose: phenomenal mix of coffee, maple, and bourbon. Noticeably sweeter than KBS, but also more complex with the added maple component. Overall great balance and depth. Taste: follows the nose. Equal parts maple, coffee, and bourbon. The maple really stands out in a direct comparison with KBS and the coffee in CBS is less prominent (not muted by any extent, there are just more competing elements). Again noticeably sweeter than KBS, but never becomes cloying. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and extraordinarily drinkable. Feels a bit more full-bodied than KBS.  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.78

47658,NeroFiddled,2018-03-12,"   Founders Brewing Co. ""CBS Imperial Stout"" $10.50/10.5 oz. on tap @ Union Tap House, Philadelphia, PA on 9 February 2018 Notes: Very dark brown-black body beneath a creamy head of brown. The head retention is very good and the lacing is even better. The aroma suggests chocolate, cocoa beans, toffee, oak, vanilla, Bourbon, coffee, and maple syrup. The taste follows, with stronger notes of maple syrup, caramel, Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, a charred roastiness, and coffee beans. It's sweet and just moderately bitter but also balanced by a touch of alcohol and acidity. Medium-full in body and smooth and oily with a moderate, very fine-bubbled carbonation.  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.41

47658,AleSan,2018-03-11,"   Black color with a modest brown head. Aromas start with the bourbon, though it is fairly subdued, at least in comparison with her sister KBS. There are clear maple aromas, but again not so strong. Mellow aromas of maple and red soft fruits. Plum, cocoa aromas are apparent, also coffee but again little less than KBS. Taste is a nice mix by sweet and bitter. The vanilla and maple provide a mellowness that balance out any original bitterness of the KBS, so the beer is more balanced and less rough. The body is full, there's a distinct alcohol warmness. The texture is a bit creamy, more so than KBS, thanx to the impact of the maple and vanilla from the oak barrels and the maple syrup. A great beer but I prefer the KBS's strongness than this wonderful ""soft"" maple syrup version.  ",5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.47
47658,Ozzylizard,2018-03-11,"   Received in a Ninja box from @Dragginballs76 – Thanks Michael! Undated 750 mL capped bottle, stored at 42 degrees and served at 58 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Appearance – 4.25 Body – Dark brown/black, opaque. Effervescent. Head – Large (Maximum 4.5 cm, aggressive center pour), khaki, medium density with a rocky top, good retention, slooowy diminishing to a very irregular three to twelve mm ring fed by effervescence and a thick and rocky partial layer. Head retraction leaves complete rings of lacing, fairly unusual for a brew that is both 11.7% ABV and barrel-aged. Lacing – Good. The combination of the head retraction and the lowering of the beer level with consumption leaves a picturesque curtain effect. First pour – Dark brown, clear. Aroma – 4 - Dark chocolate, light roasted malt, a hint of coffee, no maple syrup aroma. Flavor – 4.25 – Initial flavor is coffee followed by a bit of chocolate. Maple ghosts by on the aftertaste. Alcohol is not found in the taste, nor on the nose, nor evident by gastric warming. It was, however, evident in my mental patterns as I finished the bottle. Hops are not evident. No diacetyl and no dimethylsulfide. Palate – 4 – Medium to full, almost creamy, soft carbonation. Impression and summation – 4.25 – There is no argument that this is an above-average impy stout. However, IMHO, those rating it as straight “5”s across the board need to re-examine every impy stout they have ever reviewed. The aroma is not extremely above average – I wasn’t transported to Dream Lands by the wafting perfumes of ambrosia. The palate is not excessively better than most impy stouts. The appearance was only slightly unusual in that good lacing remained considering the ABV and the barrel-aging factor. The flavor, while good, did not transport me to Paradise, not even by the dashboard lights. I’m certainly glad that I tried it but still, it’s much like buying a unicorn and finding out it’s only a mutated goat.  ",4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,4.17

A decent spritziness, but less carbonation than average. The deep, dark burnt flavors are pretty strong, but it's on the sweet and malty side rather than the dry. The coconut is pretty intense and tastes like it's been scorched a little, too. Rather sweet, and quite bitter like an IPA. Brewers say this is 40 IBUs. Interesting smell of coconut along with the flavor, is nice in the beer.

The appearance was a semi-dark burnt orange ranging close to brown color with a one finger white foamy head that formed rings of lace around the upper rim of the glass. A bit little darker than expected for an APA. The smell starts off with an earthy tobacco sweetness allowing a nice dried pine backing up the aroma. The taste was basically the same. Dried tobacco aftertaste leading into the same finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good as an APA.

83830,cbeer88,2012-12-01,"   Big thanks to raffy313 for blindly dropping a pair of these on my porch to attempt to prove to me how not awful this beer is despite the iffy ratings for a barleywine. :) 12oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip Appearance: Color is a deep orange, thinnish off-white head that goes about a finger deep on an aggressive pour. Very nice lacing. Smell: Boozy, bread, caramel malt, and a bit of earthy/grassy odor. Taste: Alcohol, lots and lots of alcohol. There is a nice body here with caramel, and even a decent little bitter pine-y hop punch, but really this beer is all about the booze at the moment. Mouthfeel: A bit thin for the style, but still medium. Carb level is nice. Drinkability: Average. ABV is on the high side, and the beer is hot, but it goes down fairly easy, all things considered. Overall: I'm glad I have another bottle of this, because it really needs some time to knock the edge off. I do actually think this beer will be better in a year or two, as what lies underneath is not bad. It's just not ready yet.  ",4,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.21

83830,TMoney2591,2012-11-29,"   Served in a Freetail 2012 shaker pint glass. Thanks to twiggamortis420 for this bottle! The underside of the cap instructs me to ""Get a Head"". As if that wasn't the goal of every man at all times anyway... So, yeah, this stuff pours a clear bronze-amber topped by a half-finger at best of sad little off-khaki suds. The nose comprises buttery biscuit, light melon, light grapefruit peel, and a few drops of dried maple syrup. The taste holds notes of maple syrup, caramel, honeydew, orange peel, light toasted bread, and a strong surge of straight-up booze. This last bit ruins things, as it washes over and o'ercolors all else, leaving only a bludgeon of alcohol to have its way with my tongue. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, I felt this old ale overdid it a bit with its alcohol presence, with little else going on in the background. Not my cup o' tea, right here.  ",3,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,2.75

83830,grittybrews,2012-11-20,"   Poured a ruddy orange amber with two fingers of eggshell head. Relatively mild aroma of caramel, pine, and dark fruit mixed with booze. Moderate carbonation and a full, rich mouthfeel. Grapefruit and orange up front followed by sweet caramel and toffee. Sugar cookie and dark fruit mingle on the finish, which features some bitter pine. Interesting mix of strong hops and figgy sweetness. Not overly boozy. Looking forward to seeing how my other bottle develops.  ",4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.08

Slightly different character than when i had it from the keg. S: Fresh, lemon grass, hoppy, fruity. A touch of pickled ginger. T: Taste follows the smell. Hops are present. Citrus, crisp, and refreshing. Undoubtedly smoother in flavor out of the cask. Reminds me of Endeavor a bit. Mild bitterness in the aftertaste. M: Smooth as silk from the cask. Markedly different than the keg offering. O: A good beer. The ratings are weak but i still came out for the cask tapping because its a decent brew. Reminds me of an IPA overall.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.48

138468,JJKBeerLvr,2015-01-03,"   Sampled December 2014 from bottle in pint glass. Appearance: Very dark color, dark tan head that quickly disappeared. I would have liked the head to last longer. Smell: Sweet with strong toasted coffee aromas, also some hints of the hops. Taste: Full-bodied with great balance of malt and hops. Dominated by roasted coffee, but with some flavor from the hops. The strong alcohol adds to the flavors as well. Taste starts sweet with malts, then comes the roasted coffee flavors, and then a little bitterness from the hops. Overall a great combination and a great taste. Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, but smooth. Overall: Nice imperial stout. Best if you enjoy a combination strong malts & coffee, with a little bitterness from the hops. I will buy this again.  ",4,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.54

The head is modest, thick, and white. Malt and fruit are notable in the aroma....along with a musty, hop scent. The taste is balanced, with just a tilt to sweet with a solid bitterness. Firm body. All in all, a nice beer. Not sure if it tastes better while wearing acid-washed jeans.  ",4,4,3.75,4,4,3.9

Pours slightly hazy deep golden amber/light orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings around the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of tangerine, lemon, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, apricot, mango, melon, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, honey, bread dough, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/fruity hops and bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of big tangerine, lemon, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, apricot, mango, melon, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, honey, bread dough, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine, zesty, herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, lemon, grapefruit, peach, pineapple, apricot, mango, melon, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, honey, bread dough, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity hops and bready malt flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance; and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 6%. Overall this is a delicious American pale ale! All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish, great soft feel. Definitely a lot of Cascade/Amarillo hop notes going on. Awesome balance of juicy hops and bready English malts, with mild lingering sweetness.

Smell: Oven-toasted biscuits, crisp grains and lightly sweet-smelling toffee with understated notes of citrus and pine. Taste: Toasted bicuity malts with a thin brushing of toffee sweetness. Gently citrusy with modest hints of grapefruit and lemon. Faint, faint pine. Clean albeit light bitterness. Drying finish with quick, fleeting flashes of the aforementioned toasted biscuit tops and bitterish citrus. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

125646,swanfungus,2016-11-04,"   Like other TH pale ales, this one isn't much to look at. Where it shines is the hop finish that is lacking in some of the brewery's other popular offerings. The citrus aroma isn't nearly as overpowering as it is in Julius, Green, or Alter Ego. The taste has a better malt/hops balance. The mouthfeel and body are right on par with the best TH has to offer. A fine example of the NE-style pale ale.  ",3.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.48

Aroma is nice nice sweet orange on whet base dominate. Some lighter grapefruit but only get hints of lemon grass kind of strange for a beer claiming that on the label. That being said the nose in very nice and citrus hoppy wheat ale. Taste is like the nose, nice wheat malt base loaded with west coast citrus hops. Orange, grapefruit notes and lemon grass more in the flavor then the nose. Some earthy like notes of hops appear in the linger end of the finish. Mouthfeel is solid medium if not a touch more.

T: Upfront there is a just shy of moderate flavor of wheat and toasted malts with a hint of caramel sweetness. That is followed by slightly stronger than moderate flavors of citrus/grapefruit, citrus/grapefruit pith, citrus/lemon, herbal, and pine/resin hops which contribute a light to moderate amount of lingering bitterness. M: Just slightly heavier than light bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Almost creamy initially with a light amount of dryness in the finish.

Vintage 2017. 4.75/4.25/4/4.5/4 A: Pours black, not too viscous, with an impressive two fingers of latte-colored foam. S: Smells like oatmeal raisin cookies with stale cold brew and loads of sugar and a touch of dark fruit and vanilla. No booze. T: Tastes smooth, but with a touch of fire. Most obvious are the toasted malts, which along with the sugar hints at toasted coconuts. Long endtaste is mostly dates and maple candy, but there is a touch of chocolate right at the end that forestalls any lingering cloyingness. From a beer with this much going on, I frankly expected a lot more. The taste is subdued and rather balanced, a rounder, sweeter KBS. I miss the bitterness from the FBS/KBS actually, but this is extremely well done. M: Very fine, toeing the line between thick and spritzy. Never too heavy or too anemic. Well done. O: Impressive, if not entirely worth scouring the planet. Virtually no trace of the 11.7%, a mellow, contemplative, after supper drink like a fortified wine.  ",4.75,4,4,4.5,4,4.1

47658,57md,2018-02-26,"   This beer has the same great look as its more famous brother, KBS. The maple is distinctly present - somewhat in the nose and very potently in the flavor. The sweet maple flavor could present a nice contrast to the bitter roast but instead it somewhat detracts from the stout-like qualities of this offering. The bourbon also seems to be a bit drowned out. I waited a long time to sample this Great White Whale. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed.  ",4.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.39

47658,Snowcrash000,2018-02-25,"   Pours an oily, pitch black coloration with a large, creamy head. Smells absolutely intoxicating of caramel, roasted malt and coffee, with lovely, mellow notes ouf bourbon, oak, vanilla chocolate, toffee and maple. Taste follows the nose, with a complex and incredibly well-balanced harmony of caramel, roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla and maple, with some earthy notes and a certain spicyness coming through as well. There is a slight bitterness in the aftertaste that really balances out the caramel, maple sweetness, not that it would be too pronounced in the first place. A little booze coming through as well, but it's such a lovely, mellow shade of bourbon that it doesn't feel unpleasant at all. Rich body with a thick, oily mouthfeel and low carbonation. This is without a doubt my new favorite stout, no contest. The exceptional balance is what makes this special. Nothing really stands out too much, which is a GOOD thing. Balancing a stout this complex so well is a true accomplishment.  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,5,4.8

47658,Gajo74,2018-02-25,"   I have finally had the pleasure of getting ahold of this legendary and well respected brew, this winter of 2018! First time tasted at a friend’s place, 2nd time, purchased by myself, cracked open at my son’s 2nd birthday party, reviewed here. Pours a dark mahogany and nearly black color. However, what makes the color even more special, is the hints of ruby red, that make this brew appear vinous. As it pours, a dense and creamy tan mocha heady rises to the surface, foamy and frothy. It eventually dissipates. The aroma emits boozy sweetness, like a dessert liqueur. Although the alcohol fades somewhat, the sweetness doesn’t. It massages the olfactory with the rich sweetness of both milk and dark chocolate, and maple syrup. The roasted malt and coffee is also prevalent. As with the aroma, the initial impression of liqueur and boozy sweetness greets the tongue like a dessert drink. Yet, it never becomes too boozy or cloying, considering the complexity of flavors. The diversity of flavors evoke dark chocolate, brown sugar, dark caramel, maple syrup, bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, and creamy sweetness. However, the mid palate offers an assertive balance of roasted, slightly charred malt, coffee and hops. The finish is just about perfect, adding the taste of espresso beans, hops, tobacco, and a lingering bitterness and dryness that makes it drinkable. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, velvety, smooth, rich and decadent. Syrupy and with a gentle carbonation. It is a sipper, yet, easy to drink at the same time. Sweet overall with a nice balance of roasty bitterness. High on alcohol but not overwhelming; it provides a slow warming and gentle burn. I can’t think of many more superlatives except to say it is out of this world. I enjoyed it even more than KBS. Hope to have it again next year. I hope this review did it justice.  ",4.5,4.5,5,4.75,5,4.83

I picked up a six pack and a bomber. This was my first bottle to open. I think I'm going to age the rest for the next year and see where it goes. There were a lot of different flavors going on and I had some trouble differentiating... I don't claim to be an expert. Overall I liked this beer, but I want to see where it goes. Love Saint Arnold as a brewery.  ",4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.65

The aroma is faint, but one does pick up fruit juice of some sort. Taste is of fruit, with a surprisingly low bitterness, some faint malt, and that’s about it. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and Saint Arnold Divine Reserve 12 finishes semi-dry, mild, and drinkable. No real alcohol presence is detected here. Overall, it’s lovely, and I rate it highly.

83830,FosterJM,2012-09-29,"   1533rd Review on BA Bottle to Snifter 12oz 2012 Release Thanks to Lnashsig for this App- A vibrant glowing orange with a big clear density in the glass. A small 1/2"" of off white head that fell quickly. More bubbles around the edges. Smell- This is a prickly smelling beer. Its very boozy with a big citrus and grass note. A full hop note with a big bitter aroma to back it up.  Taste- Well I had much higher hopes for this one. Its a good malt base with a thick citrus and boozy addition as the backing flavors. It feels like an old ale but very bitter and prickly with a dish soap flavor. Mouth- A big thick medium body with a prickly medium carbonation. Its a bit too bitter and citrusy and needs to mellow out.  Drink- I believe this is a good beer. Its just too fresh right now and needs to mature as a beer. Prickly and boozy but the flavors need time. Malty and citrusy like an old ale but just lacking right now.  ",3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.62

No lacing that I see until I start punching through the beer about a quarter of the way. S: Figs, raisins, dry earth, with a malt backbone. Pungent and dense. T: Candied raisins first kick in with sweetly alcoholic tinge. The finish is long and thick, molasses in quality. Warm and succulent. M: Incredibly creamy mouthfeel. O: While I can't deny that it's pretty good, I had honestly expected a bit more. Still, it was worth a purchase. I bought three: one for me, one to share, and one to age, so I'm hoping that the third proves its worth.  ",4,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.85

83830,turfy,2012-08-24,"   I, like many other Texas BA's, spent the time to track down and purchase the latest DR release from St. Arnolds. I stashed away all I purchased with the intent of aging for at least one year per SA's advice, and forwarded that advice to my trading partners to whom I had sent some bottles. I was not interested in trying any 'fresh' until receiving one in a local trade, which I had stashed away in the fridge. Well, tonight I decided to open one up and see what the (non)fuss was all about. The beer poured a copper-amber color with about a 1/4 inch off white head, which lasted a bit longer than expected. The aroma was one of sweet malts, I swear a touch of bubblegum, some breadiness and a slight metallic note. The taste followed the nose, which was a slightly sweet, malty, bready taste with a touch of dried fruit. Mouthfeel was perfect...medium body and spot on carbonation. Overall, this was very acceptable. It is not BAD. It is drinkable at this stage. Although not an expert by any means, I can see where this beer develops over time into a very nice ale. But if you can't wait, it is enjoyable at its young age.  ",3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.43

125646,Harrison8,2016-10-29,"   Pours an opaque fiery orange with a finger of foamy white head. Head retention is strong with lacing prevalent after each sip. A low volume head is a bit of a disappointment on a high caliber IPA, especially a IIPA. Aroma is dripping with citrus, orange, and resin hops. Very tasty so far. A sip provides a blast of hops, and citrus - in a good way. Notes include citrus, orange, tangerine, and resin. The hops are well managed and balanced, keeping this heavy hitting beer from being difficult to drink. Mouth feel is filling, while only be a medium to medium-thick consistency. Overall, it's a very pleasing beer that is strong across all fronts. The hops are well balanced and thought out. The alcohol taste is well hidden and buried behind a flavorful, powerful beer. Served in a 12oz snifter.  ",4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.36

T: It has that burst of juicy fruit goodness on the tongue, as if you were to bite into a pineapple or peach. It's almost acidic initially. Like sharp juice bomb. It's followed by a balanced bitter finish. Bit piny and like rinds from fruits F: It's silky smooth. Medium-full mouth feel for an IPA. Reminds me of Central Water Cassian Sunset mouth feel. Silky. Overall, it's just a great juice bomb. Glad to have tried my first TH beer.  ",5,5,5,5,5,5

48348,ThreeWiseMen,2011-04-17,"   Got this in a trade with fogdog. 2009 vintage. Thanks Kevin! Poured into a Cigar City snifter. Appearance: Murky, reddish-brown body with a frothy, khaki-colored head. Great retention and tons of goopy lacing. Ohter than the clarity, this looks fantastic! Smell: The cedar is pretty bold in this one. Sweet and flowery with hints of white pepper and grapefruit zest. Interesting. I can't detect any brown ale components; this is all cedar. Taste: Very spicy, through and through. Flowery, woody, earthy; as with the nose, the taste is straight-up cedar. I taste very little brown malt or caramel in this one. Very interesting, and also enjoyable. Mouthfeel: Very spicy, even into the aftertaste. Medium-bodied with moderate strength, fine carbonation. Intense, especially early on. Overall: An interesting beer overall, but I don't think cedar is my cup of tea. The brown ale component gets lost beneath the cedar. Ehh.  ",4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.56
48348,DefenCorps,2010-10-31,"   On tap at Rattle n Hum last night. Clear brown, dense head that recedes to a disk, there isn't much lacing. Nose is brown sugar, raw wood, almost cheesey and nasty. Some vanilla. Palate has plenty of wood, mildly shitty, not good. Tastes like a fart, does this have a sulfur problem?. Watery, the finish is rather nasty. Light body, quite woody and not enjoyable. Is it sulfur?  ",4,2.5,2,2.5,2,2.29
48348,TMoney2591,2010-07-10,"   Served in a Devil's Backbone willibecher. Booming thanks to dosbeerigos for this little treat! I hope this is as good as the Humidor Jai Alai... It pours a translucent garnet-brown topped by a short bubbling of khaki (I think the shipping-caused leak decarbonated this a bit). The nose is rather pleasant, resembling fresh graham crackers served on a cedar platter, sprinkled with some brown sugar-cinnamon. The taste follows fairly closely, though the cedar is definitely more assertive, providing a nice added dimension to the proceedings. Like I said, I think some carbonation was lost in transit, but there's still a small tinge o' bubbles populating the hefty medium body. Throughout, a lovely smoothness pervades. I am very pleased with this brew. It definitely lives up to the expectations set by it's India Pale cousin. Get some!  ",4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.37
48348,urwithdave,2010-05-30,   On tap at the 110k release. Poured into a standard pint glass. A- pours dark brown in color. A tan foamy head that disappears and leaves a thing ring that sticks around for the duration. A crazy amount of lacing coats my glass. A- big cedar in your face. A spicy pepper aroma. There is a hint of tobacco or leather also. T- the cedar dominates and does so without killing the roasted malts and caramel notes that are found in the base. M- medium bodied. Perfectly carbonated with a nice finish. D- easily could have had a couple more pints.  ,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.22
48348,Gtreid,2010-05-30,"   On tap at Cigar City for the 110k #3 release. Poured into a pint glass. A: Deep brown color. The pour creates a one and a half finger of off white head that fades and leaves behind some nice spidery lace. A: Cedar is striaght away. Underneath the vast amount of wood i get the Maduro that I'm used to. Chocolate and slightly roasted malt. T: The base beer of Maduro is always very pleasing, but the addition of the Spanish Cedar really makes the brew pop. The brew finishes very dry from the wood addition. M: Light to medium body, good amount of carbonation. Spot on, just like the other Maduros. D and overall impression: Drinability will suffer a little from the dryness of the wood, but it's not that bad. Overall, I really like this treatment of Maduro. CCB has done it again with the cedar aging. Skal.  ",4,4.5,4,4,4,4.12

83830,tut2528,2012-08-23,"   Thanks to fatbeats18 for this one A: rust color in appearance, creates about ½ fingers worth of head that is pure white with mild lacing. S: I get a musty wood aroma, nutmeg, some berries, a slight touch of toffee and a tinge of vanilla. I also pick up on some orange peel. Very weird mixture of aromas. T: several different characters are present but all are subtle. I pick up on some toffee, oak, spices, very very mild dark fruits, alcohol and vanilla. I also pick up on a slight bitter hop note that pulls away the nice sweetening flavors in this brew. M: medium bodied (fitting for the style). It doesn’t leave much of a feel or taste on the lips or palate in terms of flavor. But I do find the alcohol to sit around a bit too long. O: nothing really stands out in this brew other than its weird complexity. There seems to be many aspects to this brew, but the components simply do not come out the way they should (even to the point where I doubt age will really help it out any, but I could be completely wrong). It’s a decent brew at best, and I’m thankful to have tried it since I do not have access to it.  ",3,2.5,3,3,3,2.88

83830,acevenom,2012-08-21,"   Poured into a goblet. The beer pours a darker shade of slightly hazy amber with numerous streaming bubbles in the beer. There is a briefly lived thin off-white head. A pour of the entire contents leaves the beer slightly hazy. The beer smells very sweet from the abundant malt. There's a smell that reminds me of bubblegum. There's plenty of malt in this taste, bringing sweet qualities to this beer. There is that bubblegum I picked up in the smell and some bittering and earthy hops in the back end. This blends into a mildly sweet and earthy aftertaste, though it becomes more bready as it warms and the aftertaste lingers longer. I can also pick up the alcohol, but which also becomes more noticeable as it warms. The flavors are actually quite complex and well balanced. The yeast characteristics start to poke through more as the beer warms and more bready flavors appear. The body is medium with plentiful carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. For such a young old ale, this is very solid. It can only improve with age, so I'm glad I invested in a six pack.  ",3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.15

83830,champ103,2012-08-14,"   Thanks to my buddy Dave for hooking me up with a six pack of this. A: I know there has been some problems with sludge/gunk in some bottles. This poured a perfectly clear reddish/orange color. A tiny white head forms and recedes in a second. No lace. Looks pretty lifeless. S: Up front there is a slight woodyness in the aroma. Some dried tobacco leaves. Then caramelized malt and plenty of sweetness. T: Again, up front is wood and tobacco leaves. Caramel malt and very sweet. Plenty of alcohol as well. T: A medium body that is low on the carbonation. Really thin and watery. The alcohol is heavy, mixed with the sweetness, and this is hard to drink. I might not finish the bottle. Without a doubt this is the worst DR that has been released fresh in my opinion. I don't know if it will get better with age, but I will have no problem holding on to the rest of my bottles to see. As is not something I care to come back to. Which is a shame because I am usually a big fan of t he DR's, and the style..  ",3,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.85

130475,Beginner2,2018-09-01,"   If you put the trendy brett innovations of the saison in the hands of a master, Cultivateur is what you get. Cultivateur Looks like a champ, almost (she could have a more active yeast creating little protein swirls to add to the thrill.) Smells tell me this is special: a bit of wine (probably brought on by the judicious use of brett) complemented by well-blended malt that acts like it is fruit ( obviously, from grain.) Tastes are true: sweet, complex and, finally, dry... exquisitely dry like wine. I had Cultivateur before, during and after a completely common meal (leftover pasta with a bottled marinara sauce.) This saison helped me enjoy the dinner by myself as a cheap night at home... 20 minutes of heaven offered by a slightly expensive ale. OA: Get this enjoy this. Relish Cultivateur. It is worth the price.  ",3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.27

Mouthfeel is crisp, sweet, and light bodied. There is no apparent alcohol sensation as is expected for the saison style. However it warms the corners of your mouth as it finishes. Taste is sweet, very fruity. Very thirst quenching. Apricot and peach flavors are prominent. Finishes floral and lightly bitter. Overall a very drinkable artisan beer from one of my favorite breweries.  ",4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.34

There is light booziness on the finish. Mouthfeel: Full to medium bodied with low carbonation. Overall: This was an excellent sipper.

Nope. It more or less lived up to expectations. Pours a deep dark cola brown bordering on black. My aggressive pour yielded 3 fingers of dense mocha head that receded to a thin collar. Aroma is equal parts dark chocolate, cappuccino, maple, vanilla, and hot bourbon. Taste is all that and more. Dark roast coffee with a touch of Irish cream, faint caramel notes, molasses, and oak all contribute to a harmonious array of flavors. Excellent balance between the bitter and sweet notes. Body is thick and velvety. Coats the palate well, and finishes with some nice bourbon spice. Overall, it's up there with the best I've had. Perfect dessert beer.  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.74

Great intensity and flavor depth. Perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness. No noticeable alcohol. The feel is rich and full but leaves a clean taste on your pallet.

The maple comes through a lot more in the flavor than in the smell but it is there throughout (moreso as it warms).

47658,Zythophile,2018-02-18,"   Bottle Date: 2017 Palate Contaminants: other beer The liquid is a very dark brown, only a step down from the absolute darkest I've ever seen. The head is half-way to looking like a chocolate mousse. The lacing lingers for a little while. The smell is like a maple pecan pie with coffee-inflused whipped cream. There's also a good amount of chicory. It's slightly savory, which is not a common description for the nose. Vanilla as it warms up. This is the ideal dessert beer. I just wish I had a cabin in the woods with a fireplace to sit next to. The pecan pie description is still apt. The maple syrup seems crossed with honey. What was chicory has turned to dark (although not bitter) chocolate. Slightly nutty beyond even the pie. Brazil nuts, specifically. Alchohol heat is present, but fairly mild. And one piece of advice: it's so intense that you lose out if you gulp it, so sip away. The sweetness is the main feature, but it's not excessive. I was worried about it being overly thick, but the weight is moderate. The carbonation is very fine and nicely integrated. Again, the alcohol is fairly well hidden, but nobody should be slamming this one, anyway. The aftertaste is so pleasant. Brazil nuts, roasted chocolate, and lingering maple. There's been a time or two where I ate something way too rich way too quickly. This is a brew has potential in that vein.  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.51

It smells of Brett, dried red apple, sherry, my moustach, a lil alky, and lies. The flavor profile is full of exquisite dehydrated fruits, bubble gum, blush wine, a nice subtle hop-bittered finish, and deception. It's a moderately carbonated medium-leaning-on-full bodied brew. I've never had Divine on tap so this is quite the great as me and babe Amanda sipple off it's teet. Now I'm sure Saint Arnold Brewing Co. made a good sum of cash for the sales of this brew.

I kinda don't care, since the bottle I had last night was rather ordinary and bland. I expect great things from the SADR releases, and they've previously demonstrated that their excellence is not a fluke. But this beer is not on that track of excellence. Pale in color for an Old Ale, uniformly 1-dimensionsal in taste and nose (think small malt with a hint of adjunct lager). One positive was that the beer tasted better as it warmed up, and the ""cheap beer"" overtones were muted. It wasn't like I had to choke it down; it's not that bad. But dayum SA, this shoulda been a fantastic offering at this price point and level of expectation. Here's hoping #13 is back on track.  ",3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.58

83830,Omightytolkien,2012-08-02,"   A good beer, but not worth the ado that--like me--you probably went through to find it. At 10% alcohol, it has a nice wallop to keep you awake during your mid-morning ""nip"" at work. Also if--like me--you never eat on an empty stomach, it makes for a nice breakfast before you chase it down with food. It is however (alas) much like drinking a Belgian beer without the sweetness; as such, there was no ""finish."" Don't drive 40 miles round-trip on your lunch hour to find this. If you want a more wonkish review with descriptions of how its body is ""infused with hints of pepper-bark grated from a Peruvian nutmeg tree whose delicate nuts were first lovingly crushed with an ivory mallet,"" then move along, because I speak plain English: the color was dark-reddish-brown; it will wake you up proper when you open your eyes to the harsh and unfriendly light of another blasted day, and the bottle is purple.  ",4.5,3,3,2.5,3,3.04

47658,BGDrock,2018-02-11,"   Dark brown body like molasses, and a solid marshmallow head like the froth of hot chocolate, super sticky retention. Beautiful roasted coffee/chocolate aroma - very little bitterness or acidity; some oakiness. What a flavour bomb! Delightful, silky, rich dark chocolate - like they melted a bar in it. Some caramel, dark rum, vanilla. Again, very low acidity and none of that bitter espresso flavour often encountered, the roast is perfect. Maple syrup sweetness is heavy handed, makes the beer cloying - the taste is a nice compliment, but too much of a good thing. Mouthfeel is incredibly soft, like a silk pillow. Light carbonation, full body. If they were to dial back the maple syrup, this would be one of my favourite stouts for sure. Even as is, it's a treat and a wonderful dessert beer. But one little bottle is almost too much for one person. After the tasting, read that they actually do brew it with chocolate, explaining the purity of flavour.  ",5,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.26

Finally getting a chance to try it now. A: It looks like any other bourbon barrel stout with the exception of a slight burnt caramel rim to the light lace left around the glass. S: Candied apple, toffee, acidic Costa Rican roast, burnt maple sugar, super sweet barrel aged candied malt. T: Follows the nose with smooth alcohol heat. All the notes are there, the main difference between this and KBS is the burnt candied sugar that is very pronounced in this beer. It’s sweet but not sickeningly sweet. M: light to medium body with a long boozy after trail that lasts over half a minute if taken at slightly above room temperature. O: I’m glad to have tried this beer but I’m not going out of my way to buy it again if not on draft. The ludicrous prices online are a remenent of a time way past. There are fabulous beers that can be gotten for a lot less. Firestone Parabola is one to mimic this beer if you want to find something synonymous.

83830,TX-Badger,2012-08-02,"   I opened a 12oz bottle poured into a snifter glass. A - This pours a hazy orangeish amber, not much head to speak of on the pour. S - On the nose I get some light spice, small amount of hops, caramel malt. T - On the palate I get the same as what I was smelling. The spices are very subtle, you almost have to be looking for them. The hops aren't overly noticeable, but the caramel malt gives way to toffee and caramel flavors. Sweet on the finish. M - Medium-bodied and it seemed to be noticeably carbonated O - This is interesting, it is only my second time trying a Divine Reserve from St. Arnold. I think that this beer tastes extremely young and age will do it wonders. I have another five bottles from a six pack that I purchased and plan on letting them sit for quite a while before opening another one. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  ",3,3.5,3,2.5,3,3.07

The flavor is very similar. The caramel and dark fruit notes are very heavy up front, with a little bit of toffee and some earth notes hidden in the background. I also get a little bit of cinnamon and some other peppery notes in the flavor. The alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering. Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation.  ",4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.58

The smell is one part crystal malt and one part mysterious funk, something I haven't noticed in any Saint Arnold brew before. The flavor is much more complex: dark rum with hints of toffee up front followed by dried apricot and alcohol. This definitely has the flavor profile of a autumn/winter seasonal. There's a long funky aftertaste that I don't know if I like. The mouthfeel is rather slick and accompanied by alcohol warmth. Overall, this is pretty good but rough around the edges.

83830,Verecund,2012-08-01,"   July 31, 2012. Pours a hazy deep carrot orange with a quarter-finger of head that settles into a ring around the edge of the glass. At first, DR12 features bready maltiness, orange blossom honey, caramelized orange, and simple syrup. A lightly spicy booziness emerges as it warms. A little green, I think, with a faint vegetal note. Taste is simpler. Caramelized orange, warming heat, old dried fruit, and some miscellaneous flat bitterness on the finish. The bready note on the nose is gone, replaced by a generic malty-sweetness cut short by the bitter, warming finish. Flatter (i.e., one-note/less interesting) as it warms. I know others will disagree, but this strikes me as a middling old ale, something I'd liken to a poor man's Old Stock Ale. Not bad, but probably not worth the Divine Reserve label. I think this will slightly improve as it ages.  ",3,3,3,2.5,3,2.95

Rather clear bright golden in color with a finger of loose white foam, it stands for a while with pretty good retention before sinking to some film and spotty lacing. The aroma and taste is obviously infused with brett with its wild notes of funkiness, pear, and apricot. Also obviously woody barrel character with its dry-edge, wine, and tannin, it is more mellow when warm with more peppery spiciness and tartness bringing on. Ester of yeast plays along well too while its funky barnyard and winy barrel character run in parallel. Medium body with some moderate to fizzy carbonation that is reminding of champagne-like, the feeling is very dry with some crisp and lively feeling. Interesting, not that complex but a Saison with some depth of character to discover and enjoy with.  ",3.75,4.25,4,4,4,4.05

324318,joe1510,2018-01-28,"   22oz Bomber $6.49 Westside Liquor - Morris, IL Lucy is a Klepto is a bright golden beer with a slight chill haze. It glows when backlit and looks like an IPA should, as far as I'm concerned. A soapy, off white head stands at a finger high on the pour and slowly recedes to a skim coat, chunky ring, and loose lacing along the glass. A little more head retention would be appreciated but it's a looker besides. Orange flesh and pineapple are first at bat. These notes are quickly followed by lesser quantities of orange peel, star fruit, and grapefruit juice. A big dose of pine hits on the backend and is especially noticeable with a swirl. The malt base is pale but still manages to be noticeable. There's a sugar cookie quality that when added to the orange hoppiness gives a candied peel vibe.It's vibrant yet restrained with soft edges. The flavor has the same characteristics as the nose but they show themselves a bit differently. The pine is sturdy from front to back with citric and tropical notes layered over the surface. Orange pith and oil are vibrant and make the mind think ""bitter"". The tropical notes mentioned above are more subdued and complimentary. The malt base is softly sweet, rather plain Jane but also fitting to the overall hop profile. I like this beer. This beer drinks like a champ. It's on the lighter side of the spectrum with an active effervescence. The bubbles keep this beer moving, awaken the tastebuds, and clean up the finish while also adding a nice frothiness to the beer. The finish is dry and that dryness leaves behind a sturdy bitterness in the back of the throat. While it's bitter it's also an easy drinker. Radium City makes some solid beer. Lucy is a Klepto is the best I've had from them and one that I hope to see on the shelf often. It's bright, bitter, easy drinking and hits an appropriate price point. I'm a big fan,. Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good.  ",,,,,,4.01

Smell - Mango, orange peel, grapefruit, pineapple and peach. The hops are coming through nicely as well. Taste - Very juicy topical IPA sweet and very nice hop flavor. The best way I can describe this is someone added fresh hops to freshly squeezed juice. Amazing flavors and very well balanced. Plenty of orange and pineapple as well as mango papaya and grapefruit. This is dangerously drinkable and no sign of the 8.2% ABV. Feel - Medium body very smooth. Although it is medium body it still has very full and creamy feel. Overall - This is an amazing brew, it hits all the notes from the tropical smell and taste to the well balanced hoppiness and smooth feel.  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.74

Head was foamy, off white and about 1 finger thick, fading slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing. Smells of fresh citrus hops, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, mango, dank piney hops, luscious tropical fruit, graham cracker, biscuit, toasted grains and a general lovely fruity sweetness. All hops but just enough malt backbone to make it almost perfectly balanced. Tastes pretty much like it smells but with added citrus fruit like papaya, star fruit, grapes and pear. Bitterness is mild and the ABV is completely hidden, making this incredibly easy to drink. Delicious, another home run by Tree House.  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.56

48348,ktrillionaire,2010-04-16,"   On-tap at CCB. A - Deep translucent brown, luxurious tan head, with more lace and foam than the regular Maduro Brown. S - Mild tobacco notes are omnipresent; the cedar impact is highlighted, likely because of the absence of a strong bitter hop for the cedar to fuse with. The brew has some mild nuttiness and some obviously roasty malt, too. T - The taste is pretty much like the smell. The cedar totally enhances all of the flavor aspects of the base brew. Lightly spicy, with notes of tobacco, chocolate, pecan-walnut, and peat. Good stuff. M - Well-carbonated, slightly sharp carbonation at first, but it settles into a very smooth texture. D - Nice stuff, the cedar is very enjoyable; I imagine it would pair very well with a wide variety of foods.  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5
48348,Shaw,2010-04-15,"   From a 750 ml bottle hand-bottled for me at the brewery last year. A deep amber in color with a nice off-white head. The aroma is of cigar cedar, no surprise. The taste is woody and cedary, with sweet molasses and light coffee flavors. The cigar cedar really takes over the regular brown ale flavors, but not in a bad or overpowering way. The body is creamy and very smooth. Overall this is a good beer. Aging on cigar cedar really changes a beer.  ",4,3.5,4,4,4,3.88

48348,Phyl21ca,2010-02-22,   Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a medium foamy head. Aroma is dominated by cedar notes which gives the impression that loads of pepper were used in the making of this beer. Taste is quite astringent with loads of cedar and a spicy peppery feels which is not that enjoyable. I guess some of the caramel malt is noticeable though quite hidden by the cedar notes. Overall I can't say I really enjoyed and must admit that this experience should not be repeated.  ,3,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.71

Medium to heavy cedar resin sweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a standout brew.  ",4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.18
48348,mrandypandy,2009-11-26,"   750ml bottle purchased from Cigar City Brewery, in Tampa, FL. A- Pours a beautiful mahogany/brown with some tight tan lacing that tries to cling to my glass. Head disappears quickly. Very clear with lots of bubbles rising up from my glass. S- Wow. Different. I can't say I'm used to cedar-aged beers, but you can definately pick up cedar in the nose. In fact, I can't really pick up anything else. Interesting. T- Yup, you guessed it, cedar. It really stands out and dominates what I suspect is a good and basic brown ale. It almosts tastes a bit like ash, maybe a campfire without the smoke? M- Medium to light in body, and the cedar makes it a bit dry almost. Good carbonation. D- Even for a 5.5% Brown Ale I had a little bit of trouble polishing this one off. It went down well, but I felt my palate growing tired of the cedar and wished there was just more complexity to the beer. Overall - My first Cigar City brew, and not a bad one at that. My first cedar aged beer, and not a bad one at that either. I do feel the cedar would be more appropriate with a robust and complex beer like an imperial stout or baltic porter. I would have this again, but wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out.  ",4,3.5,3,4,3,3.28

Very nicely done I have to admit. Smooth even flavor and lighter then I thought it would be for sure, This was defintly a nice little brown ale.

48348,tpd975,2009-03-08,   A: Poured a nice fudgy brown hue with a rather small head which is fine for a cask brew. Somewhat cloudy as this one had been moved to a beer fest the day of tasting. Nice bubbles produced with a swirl. No lace. S: Nice malt backbone with hints of brown sugar and toffee standing out. A bit of roast can be detected before the cedar comes in. Nice woody earthy cedar. T: Very similar to aroma. Wonderful toasted malt backed by sweet caramel and brown sugar. The cedar then plows through. It comes off somewhat spicy almost rye like. Slightly woody with a bit of earth. I really like what cedar ageing does to beer. M: On the lighter side of medium in body. Nice carbonation from the cask. D: Damn drinkable. I pounded this one and the regular Maduro all day long at the Ybor beer fest. How can you kick up a solid brown ale? I say put it on Cedar!  ,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.17
58061,Phyl21ca,2010-05-05,   Bottle: Poured a hazy dirty beige color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of light citrus notes with light dry wheat malt.

Not great but better then loads of offering from this brewer.  ,,,,,,3.45

Thumb sized coco head in my little snifter falls slow and laces very well for a big beer. Don't get anymore stout looking then this. Aroma is intense sweet lots free floating sugars, maple syrup, big coffee beans, chocolate. All wrapped up in bourbon barrel with dry oak and vanilla underneath. Aroma is so smooth and relaxing it all blends so well with nothing out of place it all meshes so well. Taste is almost as great as the nose rich malts chocolate sweet sugary maple syrup, big dark roasted coffee. Bourbon barrels add just the right kick with dry oak notes and good vanilla that goes well with the sweetness. One of the more balanced Bourbon Barrels as it all blends so well sweet maple and whiskey kick with great oak notes. Even at 11.7% alcohol is not noticed other then bourbon flavors . Very nice job on this one. Mouthfeel is about normal for a big stout full but could be chewier like a Dark Lord carbonation is smooth and well balanced. Overall this is a fantastic beer all be it over priced, maybe due to the well deserved hype. But I payed 25$ for a bottle, for 15 I would buy a few more but at 25 eh its wonderful but then I'm not Bill Gates.  ",5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.74

47658,aleigator,2018-02-02,"   Pours as black as the night with a huge, dark brown head, which won‘t collapse at all. The beers aromas are intense - leaden by sugar coated espresso beans and a maple peak. Spicy bourbon is there as well, adding a pleasant depth, consisting of earth, oak, toffee and marzipan. Everything is very well balanced, without any ingredient standing out in particular, creating a very well working nose. Has a thicker, very soft mouthfeel, with almost no carbonation, leaving a long lasting whipped cream impression on the palate, showcasing the heavier body of the beer perfectly well. Tastes of toffee, on which the roasted, earthen coffee settles, which then unfolds on the palate with a plethora of sweet, wooden and dryer flavors. Both maple and the barrel add to this initial impression in the best possible fashion, lending an almost chewy, rich and oaken, spice quality. After the swallow, coffee turns drier, maple lingers on and a prominent roasted maltiness rushes over more subtle vanilla. This is great, because it simply relies on its balance. By doing so, the beers complex flavors are able to unfold perfectly, enriching each other the whole time.  ",4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.29

The smell is of roasted malts, dark fruit and bourbon. The aroma is intense and inviting. The taste tracked the smell, lots of heavily roasted, almost charred malts. There are raisins, toffee, a bit of vanilla all backed by some pretty serious bourbon notes. It keeps reveling other characteristics as it opens-up and warms. Some woody notes and more bourbon late. It is never to “hot”. The mouth is silky and coating. It is a perfect night cap.  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

230160,pubscout,2017-04-14,"   Had this supremely sessionable (5.5%) NE IPA twice in two days...first at Maloney's Pub in Matawan, then a can from a fixer we got down the street from Maloney's. Though I liked it better from the tap, this is a very creditable NE IPA that slakes a thirst after a brisk walk on a beautiful Spring day. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy (in a good way) and there are plenty of citrus hop notes in the first taste and on the backside.. Wheat malt comes in semi-sweetly, but not off-putting. Definitely worth a sixer, but the consumer is advised NOT to lay this down for later use. Drink fresh. Drink often. Drink sensibly.  ",4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.4

No date on the can so not sure how young or old this is...keep that in mind. Murky goldenrod orange. Nose is a bright blast of citric tropical fruitiness. Sweet, but SUPER inviting. Almost candy like....mmmm mmm mmmm. Tastes a bit like faded glory like it lost its pop, but still nice flavor. Body is fairly watery, but then again this is a pale and not a IIPA. There are certainly traces of that magical nose in the taste, but it's almost like hearing your favorite band, from the other room. Checking Funk Brewing's social media, it looks like they launched 12oz cans (which I have) about a month ago. Maybe I'm missing something or maybe I'm just spoiled of having hoppy beers usually within a week or two of canning (I do tend to find that my favorites all fall off hard in the 4-6 week mark) but I'd love to try this SUPER fresh. Worth checking out.  ",4.25,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,4.01

Super small brewery pumping out amazing products. I tried the Tumbleweed at the tap room. Clean crisp pale ale for sure. The smell is quite citrusy and the taste follows the nose. The beer we had was super fresh and super crisp. As the weather starts to warm up I can see this being a solid beer for the season.  ,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25

230160,schmoyer1,2016-12-22,"   Another amazing brew from the Emmaus PA Funk Brewery. Smooth, slightly ctirusy taste with a crisp finish. Hard to describe this one because it lies somewhere between their Funk IPA (which is amazing) and a pale ale. Cloudy in appearance. Citrus aroma but not over powering. Smooth overall feel, maybe a slight bit over carbonated but I'm probably being too picky. Bottom line, if you like IPA and Pale Ale beer you'll be cool with this one.  ",4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.41

A simple but relatively flavorful amber. Very good sweet/bitter balance from otherwise very subtle hops, although the aftertaste is a bit more bitter than usual for ambers. Mouthfeel: medium body; a bit smoother than average. Overall: basic and simple but well-crafted amber beer. (re-visited and review tweaked in Nov 2013)  ",4.5,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.75,3.75

78435,gentlystewed,2013-04-08,"   Poured this one into a Jailhouse pint glass I got from touring the brewery a few months back. The body has a gorgeous, almost shimmering copper color to it and the creamy tan pillow of a head starts out 2 fingers tall then sinks to a healthy skim. The aroma is rich in caramel malt--like breaking open a Snickers bar under your nose. Very nice. I taste a lot of slightly toasted caramel malt oomph like I expected, along with some very subtle fruit notes. They keep this thing balanced out perfectly with their choice of Liberty and Willamette hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and easy with a low carbonation that make's this a real mellow brew. Overall this is a great brew, and if any beeradvocates what to tour a really cool brewery in the Atlanta area, they should check this place out.  ",4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.63

Most lacing is from the initial head but other spots appear as it goes down.  Smells sharp and earthy. Maybe those are some grassy hops I smell with some hay and mild spices mixed in. Not much to the nose.  Taste is a nicely balanced. A good mix of malty sweetness and mild grassy hop bitterness. A little bit of sweet bread, some spice and a dash of roasted malt. Feel is light bodied with fairly sharp carbonation. Dry earthy and mildly bitter aftertaste. No noticeable alcohol whatsoever.  This is an easy drinking amber. Well balanced and pretty tasty.

Unique. 3.5 (Taste) Fruit tones are in the front, with a touch of apricot and honey, backed up with floral hops and more tart fruit. This is one of the fruitier amber ales I have had. Minor ethanol astringincies here and there but nothing overwhelming. Overall enjoyable. 4 (Mouthfeel) minor crispness pairs well with the fruit and light malt tones in this beer. 3.5 (Overall) enjoyable beer that blends the line between fruit beers and amber ales. 3.5  ",3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.67

130475,Lingenbrau,2017-07-27,"   From the tap, Cultivateur pours a pretty clear and vibrant golden yellow with a lightly foamed white cap that recedes with minimal lacing. Aroma is a little acidic with a touch of funk farm and hay. Flavor follows really boasting some barnyard notes, a little pepper, oak, soap, and fruit. Feel is surprisingly light and almost watery, light carbonation, and very easy to drink. Overall, this beer was pretty enjoyable. The brett was unexpectedly more present, and the oak not as much. Being a saison, I would have loved to have seen this beer with a larger and softer feel over its thin and sharp one. Perhaps I can find a bottle to sit on for a while.

Lingering notes of lemon, peach, pear, melon, apricot, apple, white grape, peppercorn, toasted oak, wheat, cracker, biscuit, hay, straw, grass, herbal, light leathery funk, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, wine barrel, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/tart/spiciness balance, and zero puckering/astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from yeast/oak spiciness and tartness, increasing though the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/grainy/sticky/tannic, and slightly acidic balanced mouthfeel that it great. Zero warming alcohol for 8%. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged Brett saison. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, wine barrel, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and crisp to drink with the balanced tart/spicy/tannic finish. Well rounded Brett complexity for the young age, and nice wine barrel presence without being overwhelming. A really enjoyable offering.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

The nose is rich with coffee flavor, some chocolate, and there's a hint of sweetness to it. Taste - is quite interesting. Up front is is rich with coffee. Then it changes over to a chocolate flavor. On the back side it gets some sweetness. Really a rich, complex flavor profile. There's also a bit of a barrel flavor in this beer, but it isn't overwhelming at all. Feel - Full bodied. Barrel feel. Rich, and thick. This is a world class beer, and I'm glad I got to try it. I highly recommend it.  ",4.75,4.25,5,4.75,4.75,4.73
47658,ajm5108,2018-01-28,"   Expected color, quarter-inch of a creamy tan head, mild carbonation. I didn't find the aroma to be particularly robust - coffee is the predominant note but even that is rather light. Underneath is a little maple syrup sweetness, but missing any barrel or classic stout smells. I felt very similar to the taste, though flipped from the aroma: the maple syrup is all over this beer, to the point of almost drowning the other flavors. The coffee does poke its head out of the water here & there, there is a vague, muted milk chocolate. Bourbon feels like it wants to make a show, but ultimately doesn't, just whispers now & then. What lingers is that maple sweetness, and while that is all well & good, I just found the beer to lack depth & balance between the various components. Mouthfeel is very thick & viscous, stays on the tongue for awhile.  ",5,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.14

Aroma is subtle at first, but maple, bitter coffee, and booze fill in nicely as it comes to temperature. Flavor is maple, chocolate, cocoa, mocha, and a slight nuttiness. Mouthfeel is a creamy smooth medium-leaning heavy, with a tongue coating thickness that finishes slightly chewy, but wet and clean. Overall worth the wait. A fine example of the style.  ",5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.58

47658,THANAT0PSIS,2018-01-27,"   Founders CBS (2017) A: The second (official) bottling of this (in)famous beer pours completely black and utterly opaque, seeming to suck the light out of everything around it with the intensity of its blackness. An espresso crema head of about a finger forms upon an aggressive pour. Retention is good. Lacing is very good. Viscosity appears very high, thick and sticky. Alcohol legs are no surprise at 11.7%. This is a great-looking American imperial stout. 4.75/5 A: Coffee and chocolate dominate the nose to the point of completely hiding the base stout, and, even more surprisingly, obscuring the usually assertive aromas of maple syrup, bourbon, and oak barrel. In true Founders fashion, the coffee is a very deep and dark component more in the vein of an old school French or Italian roastiness than the fruitier, more complex third wave roasts. The chocolate smells rich and sweet, more milk chocolate than dark or baker's, and it is a far cry from cacao nibs. What is there of the maple is more of a sweetish earthiness than the unctuous liquid usually found on pancakes. The base beer contributes some more readiness and a vaguely creamy notion, probably attributable to the oats, but it really only seems to serve as a field for the additives to play on. The barrel is nearly impossible to find either in oak or bourbon; maybe there is some sweet vanilla toward the back end, but it is a reach. This seems to be a rather simplistic dessert showcase.On the plus side, the alcohol is nowhere to be found on the nose. 3.75/5 T: Aha, there is the maple! It runs a beautifully rich undercurrent of sweet, rustic earth through every sip, playing beautifully off of the moderately heavy coffee roast and sweet chocolate, which still remain the primary flavors. The base beer contributes a little umami and a ton of earthy hop flavors and bitterness; these hops get along wonderfully with thr maple. Finally, the bourbon barrel comes around in a big way with some savory spiciness, oaky tannins, bitter vanilla, and a little alcohol sweetness. The overall impression is something like buckwheat pancakes with too many chocolate chips and dark chocolate chunks drizzled moderately with bourbon barrel-aged pure maple syrup and with too-dark coffee washing each bite down. All that was absent from the nose shows up here resulting in a vast improvement and a delicious treat (though it is still lacking in nuance and balance keeping it firmly in the dessert beer category). 4.5/5 M: The feel is a slight tug of war between the thick and creamy base stout and the thinning nature of high alcohol beers, bourbon aging, and maple syrup. What results is a tale of two beers with the prevailing impression of a slightly too thin beer. The bitterness and dryness is surprisingly (and pleasantly) on the high side, letting this be far more drinkable than it should be. There is medium alcohol heat on the end of each sip, which is expected but still unfortunate. This area could use some improvement. 3.5/5 O: First things first: this is a marked improvement over KBS, which is even more imbalanced and is generally (ironically) way over-barreled in addition to the too-strong nearly burnt coffee assault. The maple syrup bourbon barrels are slightly more subtle, and the balance of the flavors is much better for it. That said, this is not a beer that benefits much from scrutiny and analysis like this; no, this beer was meant to be savored, a hedonistic prize for those who want pure enjoyment. For them, it will succeed, but for me, well, I prefer more balance, more nuance, and more base beer. This is enjoyable, no doubt, but it is not worthy of the hype, the cost, or the search. At the time of its original release, CBS was innovative, but it has since been definitively surpassed time and time again, just like its brash older brother. Pair with seminal death metal group Morbid Angel's newest (and still somehow dated) release ""Kingdoms Disdained"". 4/5  ",4.75,3.75,4.5,3.5,4,4.14

47658,Beersnake1,2018-01-24,"   2017 vintage poured at fridge temp from a small bottled obtained in France. Pours jet black with nice carbonation - nice light brown head. Nose is full of coffee, maple, and bourbon. Also layers of chocolate fudge, wood, and black licorice. Quite amazing nose. Taste is roasted malts - quite a bit of burnt notes. Not a ton of bourbon barrel. Lots of coffee and chocolate. Dark fruit and tobacco linger around, along with black licorice. As this warmed, the sweetness intensified. The maple comes through a bit more as well. This is similar to KBS, although there are definitely differences. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy.

47658,VashonGuy,2018-01-24,"   I've had this three times now in the last few weeks, since the 2017 came out. All were servings on tap. I also bought a bomber, but I haven't cracked it yet. I can respect this beer, but I'm not in love with it. Yes, it's a richly flavored barrel aged stout. Once upon a time, that simple statement would be enough to rate a beer in the absolute top tier. But these days, a lot of brewers are making fine stouts with whisky barrel aging. Just being a barrel aged stout should not be enough to get a top rating. Among the large number of barrel aged stouts I've had, CBS does stand out ... for being too damn sweet. I do like maple syrup, but not in these quantities. The maple sweetness steps on all the other flavors that are a part of the stout, which is too bad. Hey, it's still pretty good, but I won't buy another bottle. There are much better barrel aged stouts available around here.  ",4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.87

Smell: A scent of barley grains given a thin layer of toastiness, followed by a sniff of crystal malts, florals, and reserved citrus. Taste: Mildly toasty, bready malts tipping towards a moderate crystal sweetness. Hoppy qualities of florals, herbs, and citrus. Well-rounded, yes, though all very subtle. Medium-low bitterness. Dry, faintly toasty finish with a lingering near-muted floral tone. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Overall: Jailhouse delivers a likable, easy-drinking amber.

Aromas are very apparent with grapefruit, tangerine, and orangepeel smells. Taste follows the nose with an incredibly fruity (citrus mostly) flavor, including a sharp orange aftertaste.

Taste is mango, orange hoppy goodness with a very boozy finish I was not expecting (but enjoyed). Overall very crushable the alcohol burn on the finish is what pushed this to almost a 5 for me most juice bombs I have had are a little too sweet.

125646,TheSixthRing,2016-09-26,"   Canned date of 07/20/16 Appearance - Pours extremely hazy and orange in color with an off-white, frothy finger width head. Fair retention, resulting in a thin, consistent layer of suds across the surface. Fair lacing, most of which is made up of spotting found around the glass. Smell - Plenty of juiciness on the nose, with orange, pineapple, lesser peach and a hint of spice. Taste - Follows the nose. Juicy notes of orange and pineapple upfront, following shortly with lesser notes of peach and mango. A touch of hop spice and some stonefruit pit nuttiness mid-taste. The back end rings with fair grapefruit pith and some light, bready sweetness. Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth drinker, though a touch of chalkiness (presumably from the yeast) in the texture. Overall - One heck of a NE-style DIPA, and certainly one of the trendsetters of the style. If there's one knock, it may be a bit too yeasty, but I'm nitpicking. This is a damn tasty brew.  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,3.75,4.25,4.36

I never had the original but it was the first really rare one I couldn't get back when I first started trading, so it was legend. Maybe the game has caught up to them in the years since the first release. I enjoyed it, but I didn't $30 enjoy it. I can't say I really picked up on the maple either. Too much maple is too much, but It must have been very subtle. If you had given this to me blind and not told me anything about it, I'd have rated it a nicely done stout. But I'd do that for tons of big stouts these days, so I'm not seeing it as a standout amongst the many others. I would buy this again at $12.99, or $15 tops.  ",3.75,4,4.25,4,4,4.09

47658,MinerBob,2018-01-20,"   Yeah I bought into the hype and paid $27 for 1 pint 9.4 oz bottle here in Oklahoma and it doesn't disappoint. Beer pours a motor oil black with a dark tan head. The smell is alcohol, chocolate and some coffee. The flavor is first and foremost sweet then roasted malts with the chocolate, coffee maybe a hint of maple no strong presence of bourbon which is a good thing. A nice smooth stout just a tad overpriced but hey they got me.  ",4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.42

47658,AngEo,2018-01-19,"   L - Vigorously poured into a snifter. Jet black with about an Inch of cocoa brown head, which stays around a lot longer than I would have thought at 11.7 abv. S - Nose is full of chocolate and coffee with a lot of booziness in the back. Can only barely detect the maple syrup. Way boozier than I expected. Buddy even commented on how strong it smelled when I was pouring mine some 5 feet away. T - Taste is the same chocolate and coffee, but it's only a tad hot in the back. Very sweet. Thankfully the booziness takes a backseat when actually drinking it. Maple syrup is ever so slight on the backend and only makes itself known upon swallowing. Delicious but I really expected a lot more maple syrup based in what I had heard. Flavors really pop as the beer warms up. Drink it slow. F - Oh so creamy. Coats the mouth nicely to the point where the taste lingers around for quite a bit after swallowing. Feels like a stout is supposed to feel. O - Absolutely a world class beer. I was not disappointed, but I don't think it quite lived up to the hype. I will certainly seek it out in the future, and if the opportunity arises will try earlier batches. I really want to try that overwhelmingly maple forward beer I have heard stories about, but this isn't quite that. Drink it slow and enjoy it, it is still fantastic.  ",4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.59

47658,Bruno74200,2018-01-19,"   2017 vintage from a 35cL bottle. What strucks me the most the instant I try this beer is its wonderful balance. Gorgeous pitch black with a mocha/maple head. Nice lacing all along. The smell is incredible with coffee, maple, toffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla. Very attractive smell The taste follows with a certain maple/toffee sweetness, some cocoa, some coffee, and a certain peppercorn spiciness. Some booziness but nothing overwhelming The mouthfeel is very smooth, Very very nice. Overall a wonderfully balanced beer, a gourmet beer. I think I prefer KBS but this one is wonderful in its own way. It's 11.7% ABV but I'm drinking so fast as it's crazy drinkable! It's gonna it me hard in some time, for now it's great. I'll try to age at least one bottle to see where it's going. Anyway it's great now!  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75

47658,Buster,2018-01-18,"   Served on tap in a snifter glass. Nose is very similar to KBS, but more chocolate forward. Little to no maple syrup on the nose, even as it warms. Taste is very similar to the nose. It’s incredibly delicious, but again, chocolate forward and reminiscent of KBS. I wouldn’t say it meets the hype built up over the years, but it’s a fantastic beer nonetheless.  ",4,4.25,5,4.75,4.75,4.69

Strong coffee nose with vanilla bean, maple syrup and roasted malt as it warms to 55 degrees. Flavors of toasted tootsie roll, espresso, vanilla bread pudding with chocolate bits; barely any bourbon; lite maple on the finish. Somewhat creamy feel;medium full body - definitely not thin; light plus carbonation; fetishized Barrel/wood tongue coating. Overall this stout hits on all cylinders for me; no strong flavors, all in balance, and the maple contributed more to the feel as its flavor is subdued, which is fine by me; a pleasure to sip and experience.  ",4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,4.85

Wow there’s so much going on here! T - I get a lot of bourbon at first. A little maple syrup but it’s subtle. Coffee and chocolate in equal measure. Booze is quite apparent at this young age. Not too sweet. Low bitterness. F - medium-full creamy body. O - I wish the maple was a little more forward, but still this is one amazing brew.  ",4.75,5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.54

Smells of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, maple syrup and a hint of bourbon. Taste follows the nose with dark chocolate up front followed by dark roast coffee, toffee, vanilla, dark fruits, bourbon and maple syrup. I was expecting far more of the barrel and maple flavors. Medium to heavy bodied, light carbonation, thick and creamy mouth feel.  ",4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.54
47658,Vader444,2018-01-14,"   12 fl oz bottle poured into tulip. I’d always resigned myself to never trying this beer as I had no idea that it would ever reach UK shores. Needless to say, I leapt at the opportunity to get my hands on some. This is simply exceptional. Maybe it was the anticipation and I know that most heavyweight stouts have a fairly uniform appearance but I’ve never seen a beer look more stunning in the glass. The depth of flavour is incredible and the mouthfeel is divine. It’s really difficult to define “balanced” but CBS ticks every box in this regard. If only the aroma was a tad more assertive, this would be utter perfection in my book. Better than KBS? Maybe just a touch. Love it. Cheers!  ",5,4.75,5,5,5,4.94

See, I went with said Victoria’s Secret hotties mother because there is something mature about CBS with every sip. So yeah, drinking this intoxicating beverage is like being with a Victoria’s Secret model and her mom. Prost!  ",4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.58

47658,HardTarget,2018-01-13,"   Review #1400 Appearance: My bright flashlight will show through the edges, but not across the glass. So, we're going with opaque. Black, bit of ruby brown edge, holds a thin halo of tan foam that gives up a little lace. Aroma: Bourbon barrel, black bread, caramel malt, earthy hop, with a harsh burnt edge that might be coffee or heavy roasted barley. Light sour stout note as well. Frankly, not super inviting, a bit boozy and burnt. Taste: It's everything it says on the tin. Barrel charred bourbon soaked wood, sweet malty stout, maple candy finish. A little bitter chocolate in the finish. Dark fruit flavors, plum, fig, purple grape, all have gone quite ripe and begun to ferment. Mouthfeel: Heavy body, low medium carbonation, warming slowly drying finish, little chew. Overall: Currently #13 on the all time beer list. I understand the hype. I made a special trip to pay $25 for the bomber, and have no regrets. I probably should have let the bottle sit for a few months, it may have mellowed out the bourbon and let the cast of characters shine a little brighter, but it's easy drinking as it stands fairly fresh.  ",4.5,4.25,4.75,4.75,5,4.67

Notes of mango, pineapple, guava, grapefruit, and orange. Also getting a slightly weedy aroma as well. Taste is majorly up front with pineapple, mango, and guava, with bitter grapefruit and orange zest coming through towards the end. Alcohol is slightly noticeable. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Carbonation is slightly low but helps with the overall mouthfeel. Overall, an amazing NE DIPA.

Poured into a snifter appears a milky looking melted creamsicle orange color with a white head that holds well painting the glass with a curtain of lace. Aroma is fruity orange/pineapple juice very hoppy and wonderful smelling. Slight grassiness and overall hop pellet feel with a touch of alcohol. As it breathes even more tropical hop scents emerge. Taste is more of the same orange juice meets pineapple, mango, cantaloupe, honeydew with slight yeastiness and bitter lingering grassy pith/pulp. Medium in body with modest carbonation. This has a creamy yeast filled feel that goes down easy. Despite tasting similar to just about every other hoppy thing ive had from tree house, this one brings a little brighter pop of fruity quality. Hell yea id drink it again if offered. This goes down crazy easy, never would have guessed it at 8%.  ",3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,4.34

125646,papposilenus,2016-09-10,"   From the 16oz can, dated 09/07/16, served in an imperial pint/nonic. Pours a profoundly turbid orange-grapefruit colour with a generous finger of lush, creamy head. Retention is just pretty good but leaves a rich, enduring skim of suds and thick sheets of lacing. From a classical standpoint, this beer is butt-ugly; to the aficionado of NEIIPA's, it is a beverage of surpassing beauty. The nose is sugar cookies, peaches, pineapples, and sweaty sex in a weedy ditch. Tastes of soft, juicy, fruity yeast. Dank herbal notes, fresh white bread, pineapple, grapefruit pith, orange zest and a melange of various fermented (read boozy) tropical fruits. Ends with grass clippings and a little pine tingle. The feel is oily and medium-heavy, very juicy but well carbonated. All (maybe just almost all?) of the Tree House PA's share that signature, instantly-identifiable peachy-bubblegum-yeasty-somethingness and Haze is no exception. The booze is quite prominent on this one, maybe a little too much so but, otherwise, it's just SO damn good that it's hard to ding it too much for that.  ",4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.52

Would make an excellent daily drinker. Boat had been my go to summer beer, but this is right up there. When they can it, may become my preferred pool beer.

167925,aleigator,2015-04-13,"   Pours a straw-yellow color with a stable, one finger broad head. Tastes of bread and floral hops, together with marzipan and a herbal whiff. The nose turns into a slightly sweeter, malty direction, next to a flower garden during spring. Has a fitting, lively carbonation, with a light, sessionable body. Begins with slightly honeyed malts, balanced by floral hops and wheat. The carbonation adds a metallic aspect, adding depth to the prominent malts. A pleasant bitterness is recognizable, cutting through the malts, inviting flowers to the palate. During the finish, the bitterness departs, accentuating biscuity malts, bread and a pleasant, short dryness. Well balanced, easy drinking beer, with enough depth to it, preventing it from being one-dimensional, mostly based on the intriguing addition of utmost flowery hops.  ",,,,,,3.77

S: The smell is rather sweet and has hints of rye bread aromas.

359165,jazzyjeff13,2018-07-22,"   A 330ml can with a BB of May 2018, so it's a little out of date. Given its strength I'm hoping it has aged well. Acquired a little while back from Trembling Madness in York. The label calls it an Imperial Vietnamese Coffee Milk Porter; the ingredients include Vietnamese coffee and lactose. A: Poured into a Duvel tulip. Can-conditioned. A very dark brown colour that appears ultra-black in the glass. Produces a large head of creamy brown foam that rapidly settles and dissipates. S: Aroma of rich roasted coffee with hints of dark malt, burnt grain, subtle molasses, chocolate, earthiness, vague fruitiness, ale yeast and faint stewed leaves. Complex and decadent - fantastic. T: Tastes of intense roasted coffee with notes of burnt grain, dark malt, bitter chocolate, mild molasses, a touch of caramel, lactose sweetness, earthiness, faint spice, ale yeast and vague stewed leaves. Quite sweet, followed by a powerful malt-driven bitterness upon swallowing. M: Mouthfeel is smooth and lightly tingly, with soft carbonation and good body. Pretty astringent; dries the palate. Could be a tad creamier for the strength. Aftertaste of bitter roasted coffee, dark malt, chocolate, molasses, lactose, earthiness and faint stewed leaves. O: Excellent - a rich, complex imperial coffee porter that packs a punch. Looks good, while the aroma and flavour are stuffed with coffee, roasted malt and earthy yeast. Nice body; could be thicker. Goes down like a dream - a treat for the senses. Well worth sampling if you come across it.  ",,,,,,4.31

The aroma is dominated by a blend of sweet maple syrup and bitter dark coffee. There's also a bit of milk chocolate that comes out as it warms. The flavor is a blend of bitter, dark roasted coffee along with sweet maple syrup and a bit of smoke initially. The milk chocolate and bourbon seem to show as it warms.

Subtle and good bourbon taste, not overly strong but a not overwhelming, balanced with sweet chocolate, syrup and coffee. Excellent tasting beer, one of my favorites yet. Thin texture, nice body but not thick like similar offerings. Very smooth going down. I enjoyed this one over 30 minutes, very nice beer to slowly enjoy and savor.

The beer pours a peachy orange color, hazy with a nice two fingers of white, thick, soapy head that very nice retention that is easily summoned with a quick twirl of the glass but yields little lace. The aroma is quite nice, soft, fleshy fruit, mild funk, fruity yeast, wine barrel, brett with a touch of must and some cereal grain, nicely balanced. The flavors are right in line with the nose, plenty of fruit, fleshy light stone fruits, wine barrel, chewy oak, musty funk, soft grain, lightly bitter with a peppery finish, nice array of flavors that balance themselves quite well. The mouthfeel is good, lively, coating, nice carbonation with a general softness and creaminess at the finish that also feels lightly dry. Verdict: A very nice saison from Deschutes that showcases the barrel treatment quite well, very integrated without taking over and dominating the beer. Instead, it highlights the subtleties and adds to the complexity.  ",4,4.25,4.25,4,4,4.16

The aroma had some red raspberries, currants, lemon notes and acidic grassy fruity features. The flavor blended the sour to the tart with a fruity underscore of raspberries, lemon and an ever so light strawberry. Slight acidic aftertaste of red raspberries and lemon with a super light touch of sour-ed wheat. The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a fair in between quality of being sessionable and being a sipper. Good carbonation and ABV. Slight red raspberries and lemon-ish finish. Overall, to me, it's a nicely done fruited sour ale but not enough ""sour-ed wheat"" to call it a true Berliner weisse. I'd still have again.  ",3.75,4,4,4,3.75,3.94

All hops. Taste: Thick juicy hops buckle the tongue with notes of peach, pineapple, grapefruit pith, papaya, and guava. This slowly fades to a honey biscuit malt with a lingering bitter pine as it finishes. Feel: Thick and juicy yet not abrasive. Light bitter on the finish and just a hint of alcohol on the finish. Very drinkable for the ABV. Overall: One intense IIPA. Big, juicy, and tongue buckling. Yet drinks way below its actual ABV. The flavors develop over the course of the sip adding an unexpected complexity that just adds to the beauty of this beer. It's not just juice it has a notable malt and layers to the hops. World class stuff.  ",4.25,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.65

Screaming juicy and it doesn't disappoint. Strong blood orange aroma. Taste is well balanced. Oranges with a bit of peach. Not too sweet or acidic. Soft mouth feel with considerable body.

Closely resembles grapefruit juice with a one-inch off-white head that remains as a cap on top and leaves strands of lace on the drink down. The smell is of fresh squeezed citrus juicy with some faint tropical fruit accents. The taste follows with juicy grapefruit and a hint of pine bitterness. Full texture.

125646,SoCal_Matt,2016-08-28,"   Of the half dozen or so Tree House offerings that I have had, I still think that this is my overall favorite. It looks beautiful in the glass, as do most all of their beers - appears as a hazy, golden pineapple with a bit of white head that leaves a very nice lacing as the beer goes down. Nose consists of tropical fruit and citrus along with notes of peach. Taste is similar but mixed with a touch of dank hops. That note of peach comes through in the taste as well and there are hints of pepper towards that finished that make me assume there's some Amarillo hops to this one, which is likely why I'm such a fan of this beer. Feel is as expected - smooth and slightly creamy. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I wish I could get consistently and IMO, the best of their ""regular"" offerings.  ",4.75,4.5,5,4.5,4.75,4.77

The aroma brings out orange, tangerine, peach, and citrus character mainly but there is still a worthwhile toasted bread and biscuit character worth mentioning. Zero booze for 8.2%. Medium to full body but so smooth. The peach jumps forward in the taste but is usurped by the other fruity character and toasted bread sweetness that hovers under it all. Mostly clean finish. Just delightful and worth waiting in line to grab one.  ",4,4.75,4.75,4.25,4.75,4.66
232842,superspak,2018-01-13,"   16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 9/28/2017. Pours slightly hazy ruby reddish orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light pink head with solid retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big juicy and lightly tart/tangy raspberries, red currants, fruit jam, lemon, pear, red apple, fruit skin/seeds, wheat, cracker, white bread, herbal, light lacto funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/acidic yeast, raspberry/currants, and light-moderate moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of juicy and tart/tangy raspberries, red currants, lemon, pear, red apple, fruit skin/seeds, wheat, cracker, white bread, herbal, light lacto funk, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity/lactic tartness and fruit tang on the finish. Lingering notes of tart/tangy raspberries, red currant, fruit jam, lemon, pear, red apple, fruit skin/seeds, wheat, cracker, white bread, herbal, light lacto funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, raspberry/currants, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a nice malt/tartness and tangy fruit balance; with zero puckering/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering tartness/fruit tang. Medium carbonation and light body; with a very smooth and fairly grainy/acidic/tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.8%. Overall this is a nice fruited Berliner weisse. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/acidic yeast, raspberry/currants, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink; with the mildly lactic/tangy/tannic finish. Better aromas than flavors. Nice jammy nose going on; but the flavors felt watered down and not as heavy on the berries as I hoped. Still has nice overall balance, and is a well made style example. A nicely enjoyable offering.  ",4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.7

232842,LAp,2016-11-25,"   Tall boy poured into a tulip. Pours an almost headless pomegranate color. The nose is straight sour (in that only-barely-funky kettle-sour kind of way) with elements of red berries. The palate opens with a clean sour taste that progresses into faint fruit notes (raspberry, strawberry, pomegranate). The funky sour taste here has no nuanced earthiness (not that any would be expected from a kettle-sour), but this leaves the palate feeling somewhat bland and one-dimensional. The fruit notes on this monochromatic background almost taste like they belong in a juice bag. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated (though it could perhaps use a little more). Overall, another interesting experiment in the kettle-sour series, but another beer that falls prey to the same mistakes of its more recent predecessors in the series. Platform is a tremendous brewery doing interesting things at their taprooms, I only wish this series would showcase that talent more adequately.  ",4,4,3.75,4.25,4,3.93

60823,Reswald,2010-08-06,"   Tasted on draft on 7/28/2010 Brewed with the same yeast strain that he used to produce his excellent Sunfire Saison back in June, this is a formidable beer, coming in at 10.75% ABV. True to the style, adjunct sugars were used to keep the body lighter than you would expect for such a strong brew. It was slightly cloudy in the glass, but the aroma spoke strongly of the Belgian yeast used, with plenty of earthy, spicy notes. On the palate it was smooth, with hopping robust enough to stand up to all this malt and alcohol.This brew is fantastic, so long as you remember to enjoy it in moderation, which can be tough, given how delicious it is. The beer is only for sale by the 6 oz glass; no pints or growlers.  ",,,,,,4.17

M: This beer is big and silky on the palate with a slightly velvety feel on the palate. Carbonation is on the low side and close to perfect for the style. O: Overall this is a very nice beer with some really great flavors and complexity. Easy to drink and alcohol is well hidden. Maple is a hard flavor to balance in a beer and this one seems to do pretty well. It's there but it doesn't dominate though if that is what people are expecting.

53016,PSUDREW,2010-03-06,"   Dad grabbed a bottle from a friend in parts unknown. First impression is...meh. Not bad, but not really knocking my socks off. Not head to speak of, slightly spicy taste, watery mouthfeel. It isn't bad. You have a malt presence, not so much hops. some presence of standard dunkle flavors. But.... it is just kindda....yeah.

53016,jhoban19,2009-10-27,"   A: Brown/caramel color, cloudy. Weak head- vigorous pour netted barely one finger of head, which dissipated quickly into a light wring around the edges. Lacing is non-existent. S: very little aroma, I'm just not getting much there. a subtle hint of caramel is about all I'm picking up. T: A bit of caramel. Toasted malts. A hint of banana comes out as it warms, but just a subtle amount. M: surprisingly, given the lack of head, a carbonated fizz filled the mouth after the initial taste and pretty much consumed the flavor. Once the fizz eroded, the caramel/malt flavor lingers throughout. D: not bad. This is not a style I seek out on a regular basis, but this beer is at least interesting enough to encourage me to explore other examples. This beer is smooth and has just enough flavor to hold my attention through the full pint.  ",3,2,3,3.5,3,2.81

Limited lacing as well. Color however was good, a deep dried oak leaf brown, with the classic hazy color of an weizen. S: Not too much on the nose, I am thinking I drank it a bit too cold. I do get some funky wet towel smells, wheaty dark malt and some apple aromas as well. T: Bready, yeasty with a bit of sour apple as well. Kind of funky and not really what I was expecting. A bitter after taste, I guess hops were in fact, added to this beer. Dominated by wheat malt however. M: Average on just about everything. Carbonation, body etc. D: Pretty drinkable.

Probably the first time Moat Mountain has been inside the state of Maine so it was quite the treat to try, even if I'm not the biggest fan of the style. Pours a light amber color, decent amount of head considering it's from the cask, no lacing. Smell isn't as strong with the smoke as I thought it would be (which is nice, it not being overpowering), the sweet malt melds nicely with an undertone of smoke. Taste has low carbonation, the smoked malt has a slightly larger presence than the aroma suggested but isn't overpowering and doesn't take of cigarettes, the light sweetness helps cut any harshness. Since it's not really my thing, I'm glad I only got a half pint, just makes me want to try more Moat Mountain though.  ",,,,,,3.65

Exotic flavors shine through - notes of fruit, mango, orange, rine - seems to be a staple with Treehouse. Tastes extremely similar to the Julius - smooth, refreshing, definite dankness to this one, hops shine through, but the fruit definitely is at the front of the flavors. The fruit blends in and is in balance with the malt backbone.. it all works - beautifully. All in all a great beer - didn't change my life, but was an amazing offering from Treehouse. Can't wait to have more of these and continue trying some different beers from Treehouse.  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.73

Smell: distant camp fire at whose side unknown wanderers are barbecuing potatoes with the skins still on and toasting. woody resin also moves within and without the smoke. Taste: a near unfathomable ancient biscuit malt dying into a confused, dry citrus finish. the sweetness transits from molasses to sugar-augmented soy sauce, to mellow aged stone fruit. as time wears an occasional lingering salmon swims about.

93859,kemoarps,2014-10-12,"   4/3.75/3.75/3.5/4 Look, I'll admit that I bought this pretty much entirely for the novelty. It was relatively cheap, and I love Star Trek, so I figured why not? The pour is a nice surprise: Ruddy amber body: appears crisp and clear. One and a half finger almond meat head dissipates eventually down to just a couple of cm, all the while leaving wonderful lacing down the edges. Nose is wonderfully caramel rich, some biscuits and some spicy... something? Can't quite put my finger on it. Definitely driven by the toasted caramel and biscuits. The pleasant surprise continues Starts out more green than expected based on style and aroma, but considering the blood of its namesake.. Sweet toffee and caramel greet the crisp... green-ness (almost kind of vinous, maybe somewhat leafy?), dominating most of the malt profile, which is the driving force in this brew. There's some biscuit stuffiness, but it's definitely sweeter than most red ale's I've had (admittedly not that many). Fairly crisp, and a bit of leafy hops continue through the finish. The stale-type biscuit malts are present, but the sweet greens and toffee really drive this thing. I bought this because it was cheap and, hey, Star Trek (DS9>TNG>TOS>VOY>TAS>ENT. Though Voyager and Animated could easily flip flop. Don't hate. JJs 'Lens Flare: The Remake!' don't count for these purposes). I expected fizzy stale water, but what I got was a pleasant surprise. This is not a GREAT beer by any means, but it is much more drinkable and enjoyable than I was anticipating. Reds are not a style I'm generally that into, and this one is sweeter than any others that I've tried. Maybe that's why I like it. Whatever it is, I'd drink it again, though probably won't again any time soon.  ",4,3.75,3.75,3.5,4,3.79
93859,LiquidAmber,2014-10-06,"   Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium red-orange amber with a half finger of light tan head that dissipates to patches, with light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, tea, mild citrus, a bit vegetal with a mild spiciness, almost like a light winter warmer. Flavor is a spicy biscuit and caramel malt with the same tea-like components in the aroma, light apple juice and berries, finishing with light grassy hops. Medium bodied. A pleasant enough red ale, not quite an Irish red, the fruit flavors are kind of unbalanced with the malt, leaving a slightly odd overripe fruit element. Drinkable, but not fascinating, doctor. I'm not sure what Spock would think of it. Vulcans are split between teetotalism with some drinking port and brandy. Perhaps not model beer drinkers.  ",3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.54
93859,biegaman,2014-09-05,"   I've never watched more than 30 seconds of a Star Trek episode or movie so Vulcan Ale is a missed opportunity as far as cheesy puns or dorky sci-fi jokes go. But I will say this: its head certainly does *not* live long nor prosper; it fizzles out at light-speed pace. And the relatively bright, clear amber ale is nowhere near deep or dark enough to pass as a final frontier. This so-called ""mind-melding good"" ale has a merely so-so aroma, one comprised of only moderate maltiness and just a very general toffee-like flavour. It's lightly toasty and lightly buttery but, unlike my morning breakfast, isn't exactly something one would wake up craving for. The taste, however, does contain a pleasant nuttiness; notes of pecan and filbert beg for milk chocolate (even if this malty profile sticks to caramel sweetness). There are flavours of buttered toast and honeycomb toffee yet the finish is dry and tastes of smoked biscuits. Though Irish by birth and in name, that country can't really lay claim to the style's best. In fact, my favourite examples hail from America and they're amped up with piny, resinous hops - but that was not done here. This is no-frills, just basic caramel malt flavor and dry roasty finish. While I hate to generalize, Irish Red Ales are rarely glamorous and, what's more, Vulcan Ale is far from the style's most impressive example. Unless you're the most die-hard of Star Trek geeks I don't know that this even warrants collectors item status. This mundane ale is very much of this planet - there's nothing remotely out-of-worldly about it.  ",,,,,,3.5

93859,thehyperduck,2014-06-25,"   0% 473 mL can from the LCBO served slightly chilled; no freshness info. An Irish Red Ale would not have been my first guess as the Vulcan libation of choice, but it definitely sounds more appealing than that crappy lager with the blue food colouring that the Romulans have been passing off as beer. This ale pours a ruddy, ruby-amber colour, topped with two fingers of fluffy, off-white head that recedes at a steady pace over the next period of minutes. A dense, lumpy cap and collar are the eventual result, alongside some messy lacing. It definitely looks the part, but the aroma is not really what I expect from this style. Candied orange, lemon, caramel sweetness and some bready malts come through, with a note of pineapple as well (which is far more noticeable off the can than the glass). Fascinating. A little less fruity than the aroma let on, with the malt backbone boldly going where I wasn't really expecting it to. Slightly bready, with caramel, roasted malts and toasted nuts coming through prominently. Notes of red apple and berries are next, with the hop bill providing an adequately enjoyable blend of earthy, leafy, and grassy bitterness that rounds out the profile. An earthy, almost dirty aftertaste with some lingering bitterness and toasted grain sweetness. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel on the palate. While it would be illogical to call this a bad beer, it would seem overly exuberant to claim the opposite. Final Grade: 3.4, a B-. As soon as I spotted this can on the shelves, my internal sensors detected a strong probability that Vulcan Ale was nothing more than a cash grab aimed at fans of the long-running franchise. Given the fact that there are several other 'Vulcan Ales' being contract brewed elsewhere, I can't really doubt my initial gut instinct, but this particular edition is at least a serviceable red ale with a nice hop twist. I wouldn't buy it again at this price point (3.40 per can), but there's nothing wrong with the beer itself so I'd certainly say it's worth at least one try whether you're a Trek nerd or not.  ",4,3.25,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.4

Sweeter than some stouts, but not too much. Can taste the maple and chocolate. Barrel flavors too of woody oak and bourbon. Slight alcohol taste but not overpowering. Deep flavors and smooth dark color. Second round of tasting had more to offer....maybe because of overloading on senses and tounge.

Perfect beer for this blast of frosty weather, for sure. Super high marks for being a big barrel aged stout that actually generates and holds a head. Black body beneath a sturdy cap of mocha-chocolate froth. Bravo! Aroma is warm and comfy - roasted malt, dark chocolate, char, coffee grounds and maple syrup. Simultaneously roasty, bitter and sweet. Light on the coffee. Hint of burnt sugar and molasses. Taste is dark chocolate, bitter bakers chocolate, light roast coffee and sweet maple syrup. Beautiful cascade of flavors and meld perfectly on the palate. Never cloying but it gets sweet on the backend. Thick and chewy and smooth - a real mouthful of a beer.

47658,secondtooth,2018-01-01,"   Finally able to try this landmark brew on tap on a cold December, 2017 night at the Gerst Haus in Evansville, IN after about a half-hour line. 8 ounces in a snifter, from draft. Appearance: Black. Pitch. As the night. Aroma: Plenty of vanilla and maple here, alongside some chocolate and coffee notes. Really just a “wow” on the nose. Taste: Sweet maple up front with touches of warm bourbon and vanilla. Not overly boozy, amazingly, this one sips really wonderfully with an ideal blend of chocolate, coffee, and maple. Just a beautiful beer that I’d buy weekly if I could. Easily qualifies among my favorite beers of the 2000-ish I’ve tried.  ",4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,4.85

85230,BlackHaddock,2012-09-11,"   1ST Sept 2012: hand pulled pints (three) in the Wetherspoons in Hereford. Dull golden body with a mini-haze in each pint: white head which varied from full to thin depending on who pulled the pint! Fruity hops with lemon/citrus hints hit my nose, the aromas carried on into the taste with the same flavours being prominent also. There is a malty content, but it is hidden by the hops which also add a slight bitterness and dryness to the mouth feel. OK without being great: I had three pints because there was nothing else worth having on my visit to this pub.  ",,,,,,3.2

Chocolate, coffee, toffee caramel sweetness and slight maple on the nose. Now, wow, that taste! So flavorful and robust with flavors of caramel sweetness complimented by the maple flavored coffee infused chocolate. The feel is more of a medium but I find, for me, this helps the taste instead of a thick feel leaving a greater impression. Over hyped? Over priced? Maybe, but expectations were meet so no complaints from me! Overall, world class for a reason and I'm very glad to have indulged upon this beast.

Feel is slick and coating. The taste follows the nose with nice coco and toffee with mingling maple and just a twinge of burbon. Mouthfeel makes this slide down and not a lot of booze noted. The subtle burbon notes makes this beer very drinkable to me. The overpowering barrel prescence in most BBA stuff is offputting to me but this hits the sweet spot. 32 bucks a bottle may be steep but im glad to have tried it.  ,4.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.23

47658,Brolo75,2017-12-30,"   22 ounce bottle poured into a snifter A: Pours black with a mocha colored head that was full and creamy, very little carbonation, lots of mocha colored lacing, no head retention as it dissipated into a mocha colored soapy film. A: Smells like KBS, bourbon, toasted coconut, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, not getting any of the maple, hint of alcohol along with dark roasted malts, nice aroma. Like KBS, the barrel, chocolate, and coffee are well balanced. T: Taste follows the nose with bourbon, oak, toasted coconut, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts, hint of maple that underlies the beer throughout but then reemerges in the finish and lingers with a touch of sweetness, lots of depth and complexity, more so as the beer warms. M: Full bodied, very little carbonation, very smooth mouthfeel with a chocolate and coffee like dry finish. O: I'd made several quick trips to my local bottle shops when I found out this had hit my local stores, missed each time, then I finally found it. It's a very tasty beer but it tastes like KBS with a touch of maple syrup, while it adds another layer of flavor, it's not another layer that would make me discard KBS in favor of CBS, both are world class and I'd be happy enough to find KBS or CBS, at least one yearly but I would not chase CBS again.  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.74

S - I get a good mix of coffee roast and sweet maple syrup aromas. They are subtle though. T - The flavors start of sweet. But not really a maple syrup sweet. Kind of a turbino sugar sweet. In the middle there is a bit of bourbon bite with vanilla and the maple comes forward a bit. Finishes with a medium roast coffee and a lingering sweetness. F - Not the most dense beer by far, but it has a nice creamy mouth feel. A little sticky. O - This is a subtle beer with descent balance. Everything is there, but you've got to really slow down and look for it. Very drinkable. There is a sugary sweetness throughout the sip. Certainly not a maple bomb.  ",4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.37
47658,Can_if_you_can,2017-12-29,"   Smells like that classic sweet malt that founders seems to use in all their stouts (the malt i cant not hate), smells boozy, slight maple and faint chocolate. Taste follows suite but as it warms the chocolate is pretty heavy which is awesome, more booziness also comes out as it warms of course. Looking for some coffee but not getting any.

125646,avas,2016-08-12,"   Canned 8/3. Consumed 8/11. A: Pours out a bright golden orange. Sits completely opaquely in the glass, a murky and turbid yet still vibrant heavily burnt orange. S: Tons of orange. Spritzy OJ mixed with pithy, astringent orange pith. Tropical and stone fruit undertones—peach, passionfruit, mango. Bit of grassy dankness as well. Significant backing of sweet white-bready malt. T: Sweet, delectable citrus juice up front. Orange with tons of lemon and lime throughout. Explodes off the tongue initially, but succumbs relatively quickly to a milder assortment of tropical fruits—papaya, peach, passionfruit. An herbaceous and bitter finish combats any noticeable sweetness from the malts, imparting a well-balanced and almost cocoa powder-esque quality to the finish. M: Rich and luscious, very reminiscent of the feel on Green. Bubblegum yeastiness hints at a milkshake-esque feel. A bit more bitter—though more floral than piney or astringent—on the finish, but a welcome bitterness in its balance of the sweet, doughy malt that sits further in the foreground on Haze than it does in other TH brews. It's not quite as thick and full as Green, but it's pretty close. O: Up there with anything else I’ve tried from Tree House. Haze pops in both the flavor and aroma categories, packing a punch of orange juiciness that is pretty much unrivaled in its intensity. I’ve heard Haze aptly described as a fusion of some of the defining characteristics of Julius and Green, and I totally see this. It embodies an amped up version of Julius’ orange qualities while mirroring the mid-mouth doughy bubblegum flavor and herbaceous bitter finish of Green. It’s really hard to find anything wrong with this beer, and I’d gladly drink it over pretty much anything else I’ve ever had. Damn near perfect.  ",5,5,5,4.75,5,4.98

Beer is hazy orange juice color. Don't leave it around your kids :) S: It smells wonderful from 4 feet away. Closer in, you get orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and peach. There's also an earthiness on the back end that seems to be part of all Treehouse beers (something in the water in Monson?) T: Just a juicebomb: orange, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, lime up front with a dank earthy finish. This is really very nice. I do get a tiny bit of alcohol heat on the finish. F: Medium body, light to medium carbonation. Good drying on palate. Very solid construction and balance. O: Would be really hard for me to choose between this and Julius if I had to.

125646,BEEPOP,2016-08-04,"   I think Haze has overtaken Julius as my favorite from the ""regular offerings"". It just has everything. Look is like any other IPA from TH. The smell and taste is tropical fruits but has an explosion of pineapple and grapefruit half way through swallowing it. The slight dankness and bitterness at the end makes this beer so refreshing. Feel is easily my favorite from TH as it coats slightly better than the other 3 (Julius, Green, and Alter). Overall, my favorite regular offering nowadays but Julius is a close second. A must trade for IMO.  ",4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.62

358072,StonedTrippin,2018-08-31,"   hazy ipa is obviously their thing here at finback, they make or have made about a million of them, and while sometimes they are not all that different, they are almost always amazing. case in point, this one right here, softly hazy, white frothy headed, mostly dry hopped, simcoe and amarillo, we have all heard that before somewhere, but this one is just better than most of them, near masterful execution, is round feeling without being expressly malty, the combination of the two hops is awesome, they highlight the best parts of each other yet retain their unique identities in aroma and in flavor, and it ends u-p being really fresh and easy drinking for what it is, nice balance from the starchy malt and the bitterness thats allowed to exist. a cryo sort of concentrated hoppiness too, almost candied for a second, but never sweet, melon and pine, fresh as can be, simple beer really all said and done, but of an extremely high quality that others should aspire to. i keep being impressed by these guys every time i track down one of their beers!  ",4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25

Just a lil bit of lacing Smell: kind of lacking. Some good espresso and dark chocolate going on. Touch of maple pancakes but very muted. Overall kind of muted, was expecting it to smell sweeter Taste: espresso and dark chocolate right away. Touch of maple, but i almost have to try and taste it. Definitely a bourbon note as your nose goes in while sipping. Really good. Overall: really good but damn sure not worth the price. Expecting thicker with more heat and flavor and complexity. i honestly liked founders kbs and bs a lot more. Considering it was a dollar an ounce, i will pass if seen again.

I've never written a review before, because I either never drank enough of it or else my pallete when wrecked when I drank it. What I did have, however, was good enough to make me want to actively seek out several bottles from its recent, long-awaited re-release. It pours like a fresh, fizzy RIS. Very dark black, full body, wispy light head. Smells... more like a regular old RIS, and not nearly as maple-y as I recall. Smooth okay barley, strong and alcoholic but with big chocolate and minimal burn. Tastes, again, not nearly as maple-y as I recall. Still very good, though. Chocolate and light maple up front, sharp alcohol in the middle, and a finish of caramel, alcohol, and light bourbon. The maple is most present in the finish.  ",4.5,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.47

358072,ichorNet,2018-08-18,"   I bought a reasonably-priced ($16) four-pack of this a couple weeks ago to take up on a lake trip with friends. One of the cans survived, and it's not in my glass to be reviewed. This is a very solid IPA from Finback that does very little to blow my mind but definitely pulls its weight in a session. I also learned while doing some research about this beer that proceeds from sales go to the ACLU, which is a pretty awesome thing to do. Pour is a nearly opaque orange color with a thick head of foamy bubbles reaching three fingers pretty handily. The lace it leaves behind is spectacular and consistent, with frothy islands sticking around even after lace is formed. Good legs, too. Just a very impressive pour here. Good job, Finback! This IPA is dry-hopped with Simcoe and Amarillo hops, which are poised to deliver a really pungent blast of floral, pine and grapefruit notes. The nose here is a little more muted than I would like (or, perhaps I'm really just used to DDH beers by Finback, which is the more likely possibility), but it really does have some nice elements of grapefruit rind and pine resin with a slight floral backing. Slight dankness and earthy, sticky notes come to the fore as the beer warms to room temperature, changing the paradigm a little bit. On the tongue, this is bitter and chewy with equal parts hoppy gusto and malt-laden balance, benefiting from a solid grist of what I can only assume to be pale malt and oats. The floral elements come to the fore in the mid-palate, before the flavors transition to a more citrus-forward homogeneity. This beer finishes with some nice pine notes before closing out with a blend of oat-like chalkiness and more grapefruit. Yeast dominates the closing aspect of this beer, providing closure in a very ""NE IPA"" way. The feel is full-bodied and well-carbonated with a really solid balance of malty elements and dry-hop goodness. I think I'm most impressed by how well done this beer is in the ""gestalt""... it's more than the sum of its parts, and lends itself both to easy-drinking and to more careful contemplation with similar success rates. I wish I could get more fairly-priced Finback beers, but I'll accept this one as an outlier while hoping for a future in which they are more consistently found!  ",4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.29

Not as thick looking as some of their other beers. Thick lacing that hangs on the glass. Smells like citrus and hops. Peach, passion fruit, All the things they are known for but with a little more bite from the double. Taste is amazing. It follows the nose with fruit, citrus and a nice touch of hops.

71936,CowsandBeer,2015-12-24,"   11.2 stubby bottle poured into a Tired Hands teku. Lot numer A with a best before end of 2017. Hopefully that means it’s somewhat fresh! Opens with a loud hiss and begins to slowly foam out of the glass. Left the bottom of the beer in the glass as it was all milky looking yeast. Appearance: Pours a huge, rocky head of about four fingers (not unlike a DeDolle or Orval) atop a hazy dark orange body. Head recedes to a fizzy white cap. Aroma: Huge aromas of resiny pine, white peach, tart lime, and orange peel poke up front with a sweet, doughy malt backbone. There’s a nice white pepper note in the background that separates this from just a regular ol’ IPA. Really nice bright aroma that pulls you in. Taste: They really hopped up this beer as much as they could. Up front those same resiny citrus notes but here with an accompanying bitterness. Sticky citrus hops, herbal hops, slight peppery yeast, straw and sweet malts. While this is a sweet beer it’s cut by the coarse, drying hoppyness. Odd metallic note (iron?) that pops up now and again. Mf: This beer is so carbonated that it makes what feels like would be a medium body like pure foam. Finishes dry and coarse. Overall: Outstanding aroma of bright citrusy hops with complimentary yeast hanging out in the background (not unlike a Grimm beer). Sweet malts and a present alcohol note like you’d expect out of any DIPA. While this makes for a great beer unfortunately it’s so over carbonated it’s like drinking a really foamy beer. If they’d tone down the carbonation this could be really great beer; as it is it’s not the easiest beer to enjoy.  ",4,4.25,4,3.5,4,4.01

71936,BlurryVisi0n,2015-04-25,"   Served in a tulip glass. Appearance: A cloudy brew with a superior thick white head that settles maybe after tn minutes of sipping. Slight uneven lacing but thats okay, with medium to heavy bubbles on the body. Head upon initial pour was at the very least two finger's length. Smell: Hard lemon skin scent, comes and goes but very pleasant to inhale. Taste: Comlex sour taste, smooth yeast feel that is not overly bitter. Mouth: Comes off a bit dry, hard lemon feel at the end which is hard to pinpoint where most consumers might comes to an agreement except the fact that it stays very sticky. Overall: Good brew and honestly would pick up again if I found it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Salud!  ",4.75,3.5,4,3.75,4,3.9

71936,GreesyFizeek,2014-07-29,"   Bottle purchased at Nathaniel Square Corner Store in Rochester, NY. Appears to be a collaboration with Tired Hands. Pours with a friggin' massive head, about 4 inches, and it sticks around for a solid amount of time. This one was really hard to pour. Pours a dark, almost reddish orange- like a slightly variation of the color inside of a grapefruit. Smells like citrus, lemon peel, with huge herbal undertones, a bit of pine and moss. Tastes great. The hop attack in this one keeps the Belgian yeast from overpowering, keeping it fairly clean. The yeast is still there, bringing peppery flavors, and the malt is slightly visible, manifesting itself as the candied part of a candied grapefruit. Slightly soapy finish. This one is creamy as hell, due to the persistent head. It finishes slightly dry, though. Nice mouthfeel. One of the best Belgian IPAs I've ever had, if not the best. Perfect balance of hop flavor and Belgian yeast- it doesn't clash like the style can sometimes do.  ",4.25,4,4,4.25,4,4.04

There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some fair lacing. The head lasted for around 4-5 minutes before it was gone. Smell - Hops, malts, breads/grains Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste caramel, malts, and faint grapefruit. There is also some dry hops, a hint of chocolate, and a graininess. Overall - An okay beer, comes across as a little watery at times.

93859,mick303,2014-04-17,"   Can from LCBO. Poured into a pint glass, colour is coppery red, clear with lots of visible carbonation. Good creamy head of tan dense foam. S - red apple, and bready malt, caramel, some brown sugar and fermentation yeast. Fairly muted and malt heavy. T - sweet caramel malts, toasty, some nuttiness, then fruitiness and earthy hops. Bitterness is fairly restrained. Ends with a bready finish. It is dominated by a malt forward and drying body without to many other aspects, by the end it is like chewing on a dry mouthful of bread with some nondescript earthy hops. M - moderate body with a fairly aggressive carbonation, drying and a bit metallic. A bit heavy. with some strong dryness to the finish. It is decent, and forward but just not very tasty and enjoyable. A good red ale, with some yeasty character but just not really elevated to that next level. Profile does develop a bit, and all round its not bad just a bit of a letdown, could use more balancing hop character.  ",3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.46

93859,taxandbeerguy,2014-04-15,"   473 ml can purchased from LCBO for $3.40 CDN. Hadn't seen this before and there was Star Trek artwork, and Vulcan Ale sounded pretty cool. Figured I'd at least give it a shot. Appearance - Served well chilled, a moderate pour yielded 2 fingers of dense off-white foam that receded back to one quickly then took it's time from there. Beer is hazy dark red, auburn , brown color depending on the light. Some bubbles rise to the top of the glass. Smell - Moderatly malty, with a faint whiff of caramel and there's some citrusy notes hidden in the background. Citrusy seems to be a bit of lemon / lime mixture in that there's an earthy quality that also resonates in the instance of pine aromas. However the sweetness and general malty bill lead the charge. Taste - Interesting blend of sweetness, subdued malts that then turn a bit bitter towards the finally. The tropical citrus comes through briefly in the form of pineapple, however, it doesn't linger. A sweeter beer than expected, the bitterness I had hoped for doesn't quite shine through although this does leave Vulcan Ale with a different taste. Mouthfeel - The feel is very soft with light carbonation and mouthfeel. It sort of works but at the same time would prefer something a little more lively. Overall - Actually pleasantly surprised by this, would consider picking up more of this if the cost wasn't too prohibitive, but alas, the beer doesn't quite reach the stratosphere. Still would purchase again, if I had an inkling for it, or was planning on watching some Star Trek to keep in spirit with the movies.  ",4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.74

Very light herbal hops and a touch of molasses. Not all that Vulcan great... Taste. Sweet caramel malts, a touch of berries and light fruits, a bit grainy malt and maybe a touch of grassy hops in the finish. Again, not Vulcan spectacular. Mouthfeel. Medium body, medium carbonation. Not too Vulcan bad in this department. Overall. Not terrible but not all that Vulcan exciting either (even for the often boring style ...imo anyways). Still glad I bought it though.

47658,Betolito,2017-12-26,"   Poured into a snifter, black with a tan ring that leaves a bit of cream lacing. The smell is chocolate, coffee, coconut with a bit of the bourbon and slight maple syrup. The taste is...quite amazing. The melt-in-your-mouth chocolate is sweet and plays well with coffee roast and is complimented by the presence of bourbon and maple. All of them balance together for a wonderful mouthfeel that is not too rich but by no means too thin. The more I sip of this, the more I feel the bourbon at the end followed by the gradual maple syrup flavor. The ABV is well masked and I am usually someone who likes a decent amount of heat from bourbon barrel aged beers, but am happy with how well balanced this is and definitely pleased that it's not a sticky syrup bomb version of KBS. I am glad I was able to grab a few to share with friends.  ",4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.67

47658,Lone_Freighter,2017-12-25,"   2017 bottle. This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a pure dark black color with a nice looking dark eggshell white foamy head that really took it's time in dissipating. Lace was semi-thick roaming around my glass very nicely. The aroma blended some nice espresso-like sweet coffee to roasted coffee beans; added in a fine meshing of dark to milk chocolate. Maple syrup slyly moved in for balancing purposes - light sweet nature but not overly done. Barrel aging was noticeably semi-dry, sweet woody and having a touch of vanilla. The flavor was superb - it blended the sweet to the roasty extremely awesome; taking the coffee sweetness to it's roastiness and flowing on into the milk and dark chocolates. Barrel aging was somewhat light in this department, light spice. Maple sweetness slid in emphatically but not overbearing. Aftertaste was semi-leaning to the chocolates and maple. The mouthfeel was between medium and full bodied with a fantastic sipping quality about it. Nothing was distracting in any sort of coffee ""grip"" nor was anything cloying. Carbonation felt right on par. ABV felt as projected. Semi-smooth finish with some dryness from the barrel. Overall, this was a superb barrel aged coffee and maple imperial stout that checks all of the boxes for everything Founders says. I hope I gave this beer it's due diligence but will update this if anything else is further noticed as I'm having a little bit of a tough time truly focusing on this.  ",4.5,4.75,5,4.75,5,4.89

47658,Mitchster,2017-12-25,"   Thanks to my friend chuck for sharing this with me. He paid around $30 for a bottle here in michigan. Pours out to a viscous thick black forming a dense darkbrown head with very good retention and lacing. Carbonation feels mild considering the viscosity, around 2.25 carbs or so. The nose is very rich, with black walnut, black molasses, soy sauce, hot chocolate, and coffee wafting fro the goblet, with some warmth in the nostrils. The mouthfeel is viscous, syrupy, appropriately cloying, velvety and smooth. Acidity is kept in check considering the roasts and coffee. The taste is a recap of the aroma. Overall lightly sweet and decadent, but with a pleasing bitterness and warmth, but no harsh alcohol burn. No fusels, no oxidation. The bourbon is nice and well balanced, the syrup adds a nice sweetness and balances out the acidity of the coffee from the regular KBS. I think CBS is vastly superior, more balanced and cohesive to KBS. The coffee notes are much more balanced and sit well with the rest of the flavors. This is a fantastic beer...however... Personally, for me, it is not worth the $25 admission/ticket price, even if it were available year round in large quantities. To each their own. Worth splitting with a friend as a special treat every couple years.  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.74

Wished the coffee was a bit more pronounced, but it increases in prominence as it warms, nevertheless very tasty. Finishes with some bitterness and lingering sweetness. F: Moderate body with lower carbonation. Felt a bit thin and slick on the tongue. O: It's a delicious beer, and not overly sweet which is nice for my palate and preferences. Given the limited coffee on the flavor now, I definitely won't be sitting on my other bottle for long. Would I seek this out at $25/bottle again, probably not. But I'd definitely grab a pint if I came across it on draft, or would be quite happy if it appeared at a bottle share. I've seen comparison of this to Double Stack.

47658,Vixie,2017-12-25,"   Absolutely black beer that doesn't have much head, but what it does have is light brown and sticks to the glass, making this a really nice and serious looking stout. Wow, this is easily one of the best beers I have ever smelled. There's chocolate and coffee and toffee and all kinds of sweet smelling scents in there. They could sell this scent as an air freshener. The coffee was the first thing I noticed in this one. It seems every sip brings out a different flavor. There's chocolate and caramel and toffee, and I can detect the sweetness of the maple syrup. It finishes dry with a burn from the alcohol. Super thick yet smooth. This is what this style should feel like, very solid yet has a silky smoothness, followed by some burn from the alcohol. One of the best I've had as far as feel goes. What can I say that hasn't been said before? This is simply an amazing beer, one to savor on a special occasion. I saved this one for Christmas Eve to treat myself, and it fits the holiday perfectly. Does it live up to the hype? Yes it does. Worth the $30 the bottle cost me? Very definitely yes.  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.74

47658,ovaltine,2017-12-25,"   I’m not going to wax poetic about this beer, but it exceeded my expectations. The pour is absolute black, a veritable black hole allowing zero light to enter, with a tan head that edges towards brown, and is by all appearances rich and creamy. The first aroma I notice is the barrel, but the sweetness of the maple follows immediately, and then the layered chocolate notes hit. Wow. The taste has a significant amount of heat at the end, and there’s a definite maple presence mid-palate, but the biggest surprise to me is the depth of the chocolate - there is cocoa, there is milk chocolate, there is dark chocolate, just an array of chocolate flavors across the full spectrum of chocolate flavors I can discern. And, just underneath all of this chocolate decadence, a slightly bitter note from the coffee. Welcome to the party. The feel is rich, as you’d expect, but not overtly so. This can be your primary beer, enjoyed over an hour by yourself, or it can be a dessert beer shared amongst (NBS) friends. Exceptionally well-executed, IMHO, and worthy of the praise it receives. I loved Mornin’ Delight by TG, and this is better, again IMHO.  ",4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.69

125646,JerzDevl2000,2016-07-18,"   Traded for this beer a little while back and wanted to have a full can of this after taking a sip of this in the Other Half line. Can dated 4/20 (ha!) with ""Alright X 3"" written below it as this still tasted fresh when I finally gave it a go today. No floaties as the haze was still present but not overpowering, indicating that there wasn't any massive sediment in this. Even though the Julius was more popular and the first beer that I had from Tree House, I liked this more as it wasn't as potent and was much more balanced, making it easier to sip without being hit over the head by juice and hops! Lovely pour to this as the beer had the aforementioned hazy shine to it, with a muted golden hue, massive head, and tons of soapy lacing left on my pint glass. Mostly orange on the nose, to go along with the yeast, some booze, and candied tangerine sweetness. All of those were in the taste, which had to be one of the most appealing and pleasing that I've ever had in a beer. The spice from the grapefruit kicked in pretty quickly, followed by a good piney mouthfeel, dank weed, a bit of garlic, and lots of tropical fruits. Slick, moderate in carbonation, and wonderfully balance, the earthy hops were a nice base to the wide range of flavors on top that meshed wonderfully together. Plenty of booze here but with so much to enjoy here, who's to notice? There was just the right amount of juice and sweetness here and I didn't need a glass of water to chase this down with. Beers like this come around once in a blue moon and I can't wait to get my hands on this again. With everything in near-perfect proportion, what's not to love?  ",4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.5

125646,Sabtos,2016-07-09,"   Opaque maize with a thick foam head and clingy lace. Haze has an intense and powerful aroma. Nicely dank, the ""purple haze"" connotation is spot the fuck on. Sticky, spicy, herbal, cannabic aromas are complemented and maybe even toned down a touch by a cedar forest, sticky juicy peach, and pineapple upside-down cake. Herbal, spicy young pine and copious amounts of sweet orange and young, fresh nectarine--almost white peach--are lightly backed by earthy flavors like peanut brittle or caramel corn, biscuit. Tangy, tingly and crisp, this is not the heavy IPA that it looks like--very drinkable indeed.  ",3.75,4.5,4,4,4,4.11

300727,LiquidAmber,2018-08-15,"   Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a lightly hazy, medium golden amber with a big four finger white head with great retention and thick lacing. Aroma of pale and biscuit malt, grassy and citrus hops, lemon and orange, lightly spicy; nice. Flavor is biscuit malt, citrus and dry grassy hops, lemon, grapefruit; starts lightly flavored, but bitter citrus hops kick in in the middle leading to an almost astringent bitter finish that is redeemed by all kinds of fleeting citrus, tropical and stone fruit notes as the hop bitterness tapers off. Medium bodied with light creaminess. Quite bitter for an English style pale ale and there are moment when the malt base seems insufficient to stand up to the hops, but oddly, both the malt and fruit flavors from hops pop back up in the finish and are quite nice. One of those roller coaster tastes that reveal new notes just at the right time. I like this hop quite a bit and it is quite a bit more potent than I'd expect from an English pale. A little uneven and very hoppy for the English style, but refreshing and fun to drink. Lots of flavor for the ABV.  ",,,,,,3.77

Nice foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big orange peel, pear, apricot, pepper, floral, grass, light pine, bread, and grass/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hops and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of orange peel, pear, apricot, pepper, floral, grass, biscuit, light pine, and grass/yeast earthiness. Good amount of peppery yeast and grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange peel, pear, apricot, pepper, floral, grass, light pine, biscuit, and grass/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

On second blush, a bit watery and bland, with the exception of the strong Belgian spiciness. Maybe this is just really old and the dirtiness is faded English hops. O: Interesting, but underwhelming.

71936,argock,2013-08-19,"   Poured from an 11.2 oz brown stubby bottle into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass. No freshness date evident. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA). A: Fairly clear light golden with amber overtones capped by a 2-finger, nearly white tightly-bubbled head with good retention and a few spots of lace at the top of the pour. There are plenty of floaties despite a careful pour. I had to leave about 20% of the beer in the bottle due to the yeast stowaways. S: Fresh aroma of lemon and orange citrus with some tangy Belgian yeast bite, lightly but pleasantly phenolic, with a barely sweet pale malt grainy sweet aroma. There are some appricot and peach notes in there are well. T: A really enjoyable Belgian pale ale, I would not call this one a Belgian IPA myself as the hopping, malt, and yeast components are very well-balanced. The yeast component is a little earthy but tangy with a light phenolic bite, nothing like most overly Belgian-yeast dominated Belgian IPAs produced in the good ole US of A. The Belgian pilsner malt must be blended with a bit of light caramel malt as there is a perfect touch of caramel sweetness before the last lemon, orange, and grapefruit citrus kicks in in the finish. Bitterness is light-medium. A wonderfully crafted beer. M: The mouthfeel is light for the pretty big ABV, with some fine carbonation and a no astringency to speak of, and it is moderately to very dry. O: The name of this beer is on the money -- bitter but balanced with subtly sweet Belgian pale, pilsner, and caramel malts to build a cohesive, impressive beer. Take care of some of the excess yeast, and this is a very tough beer to beat.  ",3.75,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.26

Shoulda known better with a Belgian, but got sediment into the pour S: light, with hints of orange T: light malty taste up front, effervescent tingle on the tongue, not too overpowering in any way. Little more sweet than dry, with floral notes, little lemon at the end - but very slight M: carbonation plays on the tongue at first. Not strong feel after, just a light draw on the sides of the tongue O: Nothing stands out as extraordinary in this beer, but also, nothing at all is wrong.

47658,superspak,2017-12-23,"   6100th review! 750 ml bottle into snifter, 2017 vintage bottling. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, nutty dark roasted coffee, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of coconut, molasses, smoke, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, chocolate, coffee, and maple syrup bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. A bit muted on aromas, but has no booziness. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, nutty dark roasted coffee, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of coconut, molasses, smoke, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Light roast bitterness and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, nutty dark roasted coffee, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, dark/brown bread, light coconut/molasses/smoke, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, chocolate, coffee, and maple syrup bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome roasted bitter/sweet balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and full body; with a very smooth, creamy, silky, velvety, and rich mouthfeel that is fantastic. Slight chalky roast and oak tannins. Minimal warming 11.7%, with zero barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial coffee stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, chocolate, coffee, and maple syrup bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. Perfectly balanced between barrel, malt, and chocolate/coffee flavors. It has some noticeable differences from KBS, but is really not much of an improvement. Less coconut from barrels, added sappy maple syrup flavors, and a bit more bourbon/oak dryness. My rating was the same. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.  ",4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.38

47658,teromous,2017-12-23,"   The bottle says: ""2017 RELEASE"" Appearance: The beer is pitch black with a thick, creamy textured khaki head. It has very good retention and lacing. It looks great in the glass. Aroma: There is a light aroma of chocolate with a strong aroma of alcohol. There is a touch of wood on the nose. Taste: It has a nice chocolate flavor with an earthy coffee flavor. There is a very sweet aftertaste that doesn't taste like anything in particular. It has a nice woody taste in the finish. Mouthfeel: It is smooth, thick, and full bodied. It is luxurious and fantastic to drink. While it is a sipper it is a fantastic beer to drink. Overall: I really enjoyed this beer and I would highly recommend it to those who enjoy a thicker Imperial Stout with a lot of flavor. The beer has a bit of a sweeter aftertaste so I would caution those who don't have a sweet tooth. It would be a great beer to drink on its own as an aperitif or as a post-dinner desert.  ",5,3.5,4,5,4,4.04

47658,Red5StandingBy,2017-12-22,"   Poured from 750ml bottle into snifter glass. 2017 release. L: Pure black, two finger dark tan head has spectacular retention. S: Lots of chocolate, faint coffee, some vanilla comes through but I get no maple on the nose. T: Lots of chocolate again, little to no coffee, maple is faintly present yet the beer is still cold so maybe when the beer warms the flavor will open up some. Vanilla from the bourbon is tangible yet mellow enough to not be overpowering. Definitely a superbly crafted beer that is well deserving of its height on the top 250. F: Velvety smooth, wonderful mouthfeel. Lingering bourbony light vanilla, medium body, crisp. O: Superb beer, absolutely wonderful. Founders continues to blow me away.  ",4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,4.85

47658,Scrapss,2017-12-21,"   Served first pour into a standard Duvel Tulip, chilled to a 40 degree on pour and will allow CBS to warm during the experience. A: Deep, dark and opaque...it is dark and black as night with a tight tan bubbly head that settles into a full-bodied thin disk about 2mm thick. Head hangs on forever. Has minor legs, as expected at 11+ percent it hangs on the side of the glass a bit. Nice, yet short lived, dithered lacing. S: I get sweet and rich notes of dark coffee and toffee-like waft. Inviting. Not overpowering. T: Initial uptake is brown sugar, malted milk balls and just maple sweetness. Damn near sickly sweet on tip and middle, then tongue edges go completely reactive to the agitation of a gentle chewing action to open it up. A bit sweeter than I'd prefer, but not terribly above style. Hops seem only existing to try, and fail, to bring a bit of balance. Having trouble picking hops out. M: Alright. Here's where it went a little south for me. Slick on the uptake. There's a certain chalkiness on ultimate finish that disrupted by the opposite, a sweet cloying sensation. Slightly bitter, coffee dominant ultimate breath on retro-hale. Best part of this beer is that retro-hale. O: CBS is a rare item and it has been only periodically issued. Grab it while you can and only if you really can afford this slightly expensive release: one to drink and one to cellar is a luxury IMO. I really had no intention of ever really seeking it or having a chance of trying it. Is it worth $30 a bomber with (now) year round FBS? Probably not. I see what they tried to do here, I just don't see the value here.  ",4.75,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.25,4.23

93859,biboergosum,2013-05-19,"   355ml bottle. This is the 3rd incarnation of a 'Vulcan Ale' brewed for the tourist-trap town of Vulcan, Alberta, by the same number of different satellite breweries, and yet they still can't get the grammar on the label (Mild-Melding Good) right. The beer in front of me exists ostensibly to help celebrate said community's centennial, and seems to be promoted by something called 'Pluto's Moon Beer Company'. This beer pours a (sadly not bright mouthwash blue) sort of hazy medium copper amber colour, with two fingers of densely foamy, somewhat bubbly pale beige head, which leaves a few instances of rocky planet cliff lace around the glass as it evenly subsides. It smells of bready, sharply biscuity, and a tad buttery pale malt, softly underripe apple, subtly spicy black pepper, and subdued leafy, grassy hops. The taste is a fair bit sweeter, the malt gaining some caramelized toffee character on top of the stoic biscuit essence, blended stone fruit providing a nice bittersweet offset, as the earthy hops take a sullen backseat to it all. The bubbles are a wee bit frothy at first, and generally tame thereafter, the body an adequate medium weight, with a nod here and there towards generic smoothness. It finishes off-dry, the diacetyl-striped malt not really getting much support from either fruit or hop. An equitably drinkable Irish red ale, the multi-talented malt the star here, with enough drying qualities to keep this Star Trek heretic on board. It is nice to see that as this 'series' progresses, Delancey is partnering with more interesting breweries along the way, though I will keep a special place in my heart for that first bright blue ale from Paddock Wood.  ",3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.73

52954,frozyn,2018-01-07,"   Poured into an appropriately Nordic tulip glass after 10 minutes on the counter. Pours a perfectly clear copper, with a slightly off-white vibrant head that slowly recedes into a film and rim around the edge, and leaves plenty of lacing behind. Most IPAs steer away from this color these days in NYC, but the clarity is damn impressive. My half-asleep cat is confused as to why he can see me through the glass. Honey and malt come first on the aroma, pleasantly different from my usual IPA fare, followed by an earthy, piney, almost evergreen hop note. A straight forward aroma, a bit muted, but pleasant. Flavor follows the aroma closely at first, but as the sip warms up the hops take front and center stage. The introduction is definitely the pine/evergreen note, but it quickly changes into a fruity flavor. I get why their website talks about black currant and figs -- I would not have thought of that without looking, but it's spot on. I also get a little plum, but it's nearly non-existant, so I wonder if I'm stretching for it. There's a honey, caramel sweetness to it, and it's a quite pleasing contrast to the hops. Light to medium body, nice carbonation zip, with plenty of resin. The flavor is overall fairly subdued, in a very good way. It's not a beer that beats you over the head, nor is it a beer that takes excessive effort to dissect. I look forward to trying this fresh someday at the brewery in Gotland, as I imagine my future travels will inevitably take me to Sweden.  ",4,3.5,4,4,3.75,3.83

325639,StonedTrippin,2018-02-09,"   robust porter with coconut, a cool beer from these guys, and smart in a couple of ways. first, its not sweet at all, i almost always expect coconut beers to be sugary and desserty, which to me is often a turn off, but here the base porter is quite dry, and the added coconut doesnt contribute much sugar, so we have the flavor without the sweet, meaning a much more drinkable pint than it would otherwise be. the other thing that i like here is the integration of the coconut into the base porter, which is roasty and flavorful on its own. the coconut never feels like an intrusion or disruption to that, and in fact serves to highlight the coffee-like dark barley and light smoke character in here. its toasted and natural tasting, with maybe a hint of vanilla to it. the beer is pleasant to drink on, and i like the alcohol staying quite low in here, especially with the 20 ounce pints that kicked my butt all over ontario this week. a little thin on body and a little light on carbonation, more of both would make this even better, but the beer is very good and well worth checking out if you see it around. one of the more ambitious beers i had this week.  ",4,4,4,3.75,4,3.98

47658,Uniobrew31,2017-12-20,"   The best Barrel aged stout I have had in a while. Maybe because it is aged in maple instead of bourbon barrels. The look is perfect. I was worried that it might be on the flat side but it pours with a thick head that does not dissipate rapidly. A nice rocky head! Smell is just a bit boozy but mostly sweet roasted malts and dark chocolate. Taste, I'm not an expert on rating but this stuff is warm on the palate, dark roasted malt with a nicely balanced chocolate and coffee. The maple is not overbearing but it is there. it really plays well with the high abv and bitter notes. The feel is soft carbonation and richness. It is perfect for the style Over all I am glad I treated myself to this guy. It was a great beer that should be enjoyed at least once by anyone who likes this style. It is the best beer founders makes by far. I would take this over KBS any day. Well done!  ",5,4.5,4.75,5,5,4.78

47658,Dan411,2017-12-20,"   Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout-""Balanced Complexity"" Look is dark brown/black. I poured this very slowly, having watched some recent video reviews. This delicate pour resulted in a thin creamy head of small, tightly compact bubbles. Enough light penetrated , allowing me to see lazy streaming bubbles at the bottom of my nucleated tulip. Smell is an amazing balance of sweet maple, chocolate, coffee, and bourbon barrel sweetness (tinge of booze). Nothing really takes the driver's seat, with each individual note coming in balanced waves. Now, more coffee and chocolate came out as the beer warmed further. Feel is medium, both in mouth feel and creamy carbonation. This imperial is far from chewy or viscous. Taste is much like the nose, with sweet maple leading, followed by coffee, chocolate, and the bourbon barrel sweetness finishing last. Very, very balanced with all the flavors bouncing off and complimenting each other. Overall, I hate to use the word ""smooth,"" but that's this beer. The sweet maple, bourbon, dark chocolate, and coffee pulls your taste buds back and forth, with no clear victor. I am curious to see how the other bottle cellars. Edit to add a brief ""cellaring."" So I saved this beer for my birthday, so it's got approximately 7 more months on it. Coffee is almost non-existent. Dark chocolate is up front and playing a major part. The maple has become just a generic sweetness that doesn't really point to any specific origin. Still a good beer, but follow Founder's advice and enjoy fresh.  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.58

Complex taste with just the right combo of chocolate, bourbon and maple, with a slight hint of coffee, this is a must try.

47658,amano_h,2017-12-19,"   I could probably write an equivalent of a graduate thesis on the impact of the first batch of this beer to the craft beer community and the way the current batch is being portrayed to the same community, with the added factor of secondary market shitlords in play, but I won't because ain't nobody got time for that. But with CBS I decided to try something different from what I usually do with my beer reviews: whereas the majority of the reactions to this beer seem to be something akin to disappointment--which is understandable if you take into consideration the impact that a stout brewed with maple would have had in 2011 as opposed to now--there were a few that were fervently assertive in claiming that the 2017 batch of CBS becomes a different animal once it's given some time to warm up. I therefore decided to pour two separate glasses and do two reviews, with one at 40°F and the other at 55°F. Given the astounding levels of innovation and improvement that takes place in any industry within a span of 6 years, I'm not surprised at the majority opinion of this brew (to wit: it sucks), based on the vibes this brew puts out straight out of the fridge at around 40°F which is the temperature at which most beer drinkers will drink beer because, who the fuck has the money to land whales and maintain a temperature-controlled cellar at the same time. At colder temps, this beer exhibits aromas of light maple syrup that smell more like honey; bitter cacao nibs follow, with medium-roast espresso notes at bay. There's a grainy scent reminiscent of mushy cereal grain and rolled oats which also join the party toward the end, but is eventually overpowered by more of the persistently sweet maple. On the palatal department, the faint maple leads off, followed by distinctly separate flavors of low-fat chocolate milk, and 88% dark chocolate. The coffee manifests itself into existence in the form of French-press sludge from burnt ""espresso blend"" coffee beans; toward the end there's a slight honey-like cloying sweetness which I'm not digging at the moment. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ The mouthfeel at this point is half way between being medium and full-bodied; there' a gorgeous creamy initial mouthfeel, with an exuberant slick and silkiness which coats the tongue with each sip, There is however, some heat detectable toward the very end. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ At warmer temps, the more obtuse elements come together to present a more united front than there was previously before, with harmony being the key factor involved in showcasing the strengths of the brew. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ On the aroma department, the maple is no longer limited to just providing a sugary honey-like presence, but the more natural raw wood-like elements of the ingredient is represented front and center. The maple introduction is well supported by a huge mocha-like backdrop; a soothing medium-roast Americano and 67% cacao chocolate bar mix mingles almost effortlessly to carefully balance out the maple constituents that were initially introduced. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ The palatal sensation closely matches the aroma in terms of the overarching theme; the maple, coffee, and chocolate are balanced in such a delightful manner as to provide a beautiful contract between the subtly sweet maple and the coffee at play. After the maple and coffee are through with their cat fight, the chocolate swoops in to add a nice bitter drying touch to beckon a repeat taste. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Where the aroma and taste benefited from a little time and temperature, the mouthfeel suffers in contrast; after 30 minutes of being exposed to a non-vacuum environment, the brew inches closer to becoming medium-bodied, and the rich creamy initial mouthfeel disappears. If you can get this brew to somehow exhibit the smell/taste which it exhibits at 55 degrees while maintaining a 40 degrees mouthfeel, you've probably brewed the perfect BA Maple Stout.  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.41

71936,clayrock81,2013-08-02,"   Poured a cloudy, yeasty orange body with dense head that dies slow and left lace patches. I pick up the yeast in the aroma as well, and some Belgian spice but also a nice little bit of citric hops. Really smooth body that is light and easy to drink, I get a good amount of sweetness and easy drinking ability from the heavy yeast concentration as well as touches of sweet fruit that'll I use the generic term ""tropical fruit"". Like your typical Belgian ale in that you might also say the sweetness is derived from candi sugar and there's some spce and citric/orange flavors, but the hops do come out and give it a sharp hoppy edge that finishes crisp (also well carbonated). I like the balance in this beer and really enjoyed it but the double IPA moniker seems to be a bit of a misnomer when compared to overly hopped American DIPAs.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

This just appears malty sweet, almost like fresh wort or caramelized sugar/syrup. This head is a light tan with a medium retention that fades to nothing. Aroma: malty sweetness, alcohol and brown sugar. No oak aroma from the barrel aging. Flavor: there are quite a few layers; lots of complexity. Brown sugar, light toffee, malt sweetness, rye bread, alcohol – or maybe that’s that rum BA. Not warming, but the alcohol doesn’t hide either. Not hot, though. Mouthfeel: very nice; this beer starts out light-medium, but then its body matures and shows some weight. This will creep on you. Overall: in my opinion, in the Land of Enchantment, La Cumbre reigns supreme. I bought this beer because I think La Cumbre produces some damn good beer, especially in the hoppy categories. I was skeptical of the 151 rum BA, but it works in this beer. Lots of complexity. Very well done.  ",3.75,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.13

T: Smoke, raisins, treacle, coffee, toasted biscuit. Semi-sweet. F: Thin body with a little carbonation. Short, dry finish. O: This is a rich, dark ale with strong, roasted malt characteristics and moderate bitterness. A pleasant sipper. Tastes stronger than its 4.5% ABV.  ",,,,,,3.74

149652,ONovoMexicano,2014-12-14,"   Poured from a 32 ounce Boston growler into a snifter. Deep brown almost black body with amber hues and light trickling carbonation visible. The head is a creamy finger and a half thick, khaki-colored and persistent. Lace slicks the side of the glass. 4.5 Deep raisiny aroma with caramel mixed in and a touch of vanilla and sweet bread. Sticky toffee occurs to me as well. The aroma is sweet but moderately so. 4 Raisin heavy, but also a tad like grape soda with the syrupy sweetness. Caramel and vanilla can be tasted throughout but I notice them most on the finish. Booze is there, maybe more perceivable than desired, but far from offensive. 4 It's a tad hot, but still pretty drinkable. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy and viscous with a slight sensation like syrup. Carbonation is light but noticeable and there's an ever-so-faint hop bitterness and bite. I particularly appreciate the light touch on the hops. 4 A good English barleywine for sure, but I'm not sure what the rum barrels contributed to the party. I didn't detect any rum flavors nor anything particularly barrel-like. Still, the final product stands on its own and I enjoy it so I'm just going to roll with it.  ",4.5,4,4,4,4,4.03

71936,Brenden,2013-04-14,"   A golden-yellow color that's not marred by the murkiness in the depth, further complemented by swirling and settling yeast sediment, this beer screams pure and unfiltered. It develops a nice head that rises over a finger and settles for a while. Lacing clings all over the place in rings, legs and paces to the bottom of the glass. Belgian yeast is in moderation, as is the hopping for a beer claiming ""double"" status, though it certainly couldn't be deinied that it is hoppy. Drink it in the same setting with some big, really hoppy beers, though, and it'll be on the lighter, softer side. It doesn't do it too much discredit, as it balances very nicely and displays a nice sweetness that the bitterness that is there offsets. The ripe fruits and citrus balanced by light earth and breads with a bit of spiciness make up a nicely complex flavor. A bit more bright citrus ad bitterness from the hops would push this into territory few beers are in, but it remains a good one nonetheless. The body is light but creeps into medium territory with a rolling creaminess that comes off a steady carbonation to work alongside a crisp bite.  ",4.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.92

It poured with a two finger high dense light beige head that has excellent retention properties and consistently left a sizeable head covering the surface and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass. S: There are moderate aromas of Belgian yeast in the nose along with some hints of citrusy hops. T: The taste is similar to the smell and has flavors of Belgian yeast and orange citrus along with notes of apricots and some hints of spices towards the finish, although the yeast is what really lingers in the aftertaste. A light amount of bitterness is present. M: It feels medium-bodied and both smooth and chewy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. O: This is an interesting beer in which the alcohol is very well hidden.  ",4.5,4,4,4,4,4.03
71936,RblWthACoz,2012-07-30,"   Wow. Utterly amazing. This is hands down the smoothest Belgian IPA I've ever had. Ever. The hop tones are very gentle, which would make me think it was only a Belgian IPA and not a ""double"". (at 7.8%, can it really be a double??) The marriage of styles between Belgian and IPA is without a flaw. Certainly, there could be a bit more punch, but we'll ignore that American expectation of mine and enjoy this for what it is. Gaverhopke is my favorite brewery for a reason. It was a pleasure being able to try this one. Funny label too.  ",4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.48
71936,dbrauneis,2012-07-24,"   A: Pours a very hazy to cloudy golden yellow to orange in color with significant amounts of dark visible yeast sediment in suspension. The beer has a three finger tall dense off-white head that reduces to a dense quarter finger head covering the entire surface of the beer. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed. S: Light to moderate aromas of pale malts with orange/citrus hops, light fruit, powdery yeast, and some spices. Similar to a tripel hiding under some hops. T: Very similar to the smell with a certain light sweetness from the pale malts. There are hints of light fruits with a light amount of orange/citrus hops which does not give a lot of bitterness. There is a moderate amount of powdery yeast flavors. Again, similar to the tasty of a hoppy tripel. M: Just a hint shy of medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly thin, lightly coats the inside of your mouth, and light amounts of dryness in the finish. O: This is a very interesting beer with a complex smell and taste. The alcohol is pretty well hidden considering the 7.8% ABV. Enjoyable and easy to drink though not a sessionable beer, one that you have to take your time sipping.  ",4,4,4.5,4,4,4.2
71936,bfields4,2012-07-23,"   Slightly hazy golden body. Large frothy off-white head. Leaves a nice lace. Very pungent aroma. A little citrus from the hop, but more of that resiny hop aroma. A bit of caramel. Nice flavor more of that caramel malt, but still heavy on the resiny hop. A bit of orange and slightly fruity. Good simple flavors that work very well together. more of a traditional IPA from a Belgian brewer than what I've come to expect from Belgian IPAs. I thought this was a delicious brew. Alcohol is also very well hidden.  ",4,4,4.5,4,4,4.2

A carefull pour yields a massive three finger off-white head with good retention and massive lacing. Muted aroma of sweet malt, citrus hops and light fruit. Flavor is light fruit; peach and apricot, caramel, overlaid with hop bitterness and tripel spicing. Finishes with dry toffee, fruit and hops. Lives up to its name with a nice blend of sweet fruit and neutral hop bitterness. Lively carbonation and medium body provides a nice mouth feel. A refreshing and interesting take on an Belgian ale / IPA. Well done.  ",4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.08

Roasty coffee, vanilla, and bourbon booze on the nose. Hints of dark chocolate. Opens up quickly, should warm up really nicely. Coffee, booze, and sweet maple combines with notes of vanilla. Such an awesome combination. On the tongue I get a lot of the barrel too, a nice oakiness that fights through the bourbon and syrupy sweetness. Works wonderfully together. Malt and toffee linger. Sticky, smooth, and a nice subtle but present carb level that really closes this beer out great.  ",4.5,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,4.84

47658,SawDog505,2017-12-17,"   So once and a great while you have a beer that has so much hype, that you figure it can't possibly live up to you expectations, well I would change anything about this gem. Poured near room temperature and got a massive 2 plus finger mocha head that has incredible retention, and leaves thick streaks of lace all over the place. Smell is roasted dry coffee, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, maple, pipe tobacco, leather, toffee, and a healthy dose of oaky bourbon opens up your sinuses letting you know you are in for greatness. Taste follows roasty expresso, deep dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, toffee, tobacco, leather, and a blast of bourbon takes your palate on a journey, just incredible. Mouthfeel is big and chewy, the perfect amount of life for a beer of this girth, just a little dry as it should be, and at 11.7% ABV a sipper that has so much going on you try to slow yourself down, but it is utterly deliscious it is impossible. Overall this is just incredible, I was able to purchase plenty so my cellar will be in good shape for Holidays and special occasions. This stuff has earned its hype and lived up to it. Tic 1,500 and a worthy one for sure.  ",5,5,5,5,5,5

47658,IKR,2017-12-16,"   2017 Vintage Appearance: Black with a generous-size, thick and dark beige head that slowly faded. A very good looking Imperial Stout that epitomizes what I'd want in a stout's appearance. Smell: Upfront maple/brown sugar, mild coffee, and moderate Bourbon. Taste: The taste profile features moderate coffee notes, moderate Bourbon notes, moderate chocolate, moderate maple/brown sugar notes, and mild tannic oak notes. The taste profile nicely balances all of these elements. While I found the 2017 KBS bottles somewhat abrasive with the roast malts and coffee notes the taste notes in CBS are rounded and less aggressive. There is a bit more sweetness but the coffee and roast malts counter it. Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. The body is spot on where it needs to be. Overall: My first CBS and I wondered if it was going to be better than KBS which I also like. For me there is no doubt this is a step up. I just happened to be at a beer store where the owner brought it to my attention. I almost refused due to the price but I figured I would try it once and be done with it. Glad I didn't pass because this is a top notch Imperial Stout.  ",4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.67

The beer pours a solid gold color with very good head retention and considerable sticky lacing. This beer has a very intriguing nose, showcasing an unusual blend of honey, gin, lime and cherry orange citrus. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this beer, and once again I'm picking up considerable gin, lime and now tea leaves. The complex flavor array in this beer is truly amazing and unsual, and I'm really digging it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit lean, but with a long, complex, slightly hoppy finish. Alcohol is somewhat noticeable, but not overly so. Also, the light bitterness in the finish seemed to perfectly balance the modest sweetness in this beer. Wow! Like nothing I can recall ever having before. It's beers like this that make the event at Max's so much fun to attend!  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.45

Fades moderately quickly to a thin layer and a few clumps of lace. Despite a careful pour, still an abundant amount of sediment. Mildly sweet, bready aroma, Belgian yeast, ripe fruit, light citrus and orange hops. Lighter medium body with soft carbonation and a watery, slightly bitter/cardboardy finish. Sweet flavor, light phenols, bready malt and yeasty fruitiness before turning to a musty, stale finish. Very little hop presence unfortunately. I'd like to try a fresher sample or one that has aged a little more gracefully than the bottle I had. edit: After speaking to Jean, this is a new batch, but less hoppy than the first  ",3.5,4,4,3,3.5,3.77

The lacing on this brew was nice and sticky looking. The smell of the beer was also quite present and inviting. The aromas of Belgian yeast and hops come together and create a bready citrus floral aroma. The taste of the beer was hoppy, really good amount of sweetness and bitterness from start to finish.

Pretty good lacing. S: Smelled mainly of hops, possibly with a bit of fruit mixed in as well. Not an overpowering aroma, but pleasant enough. T: A very hoppy (at least for a Belgian beer) flavor, with a slightly fruity aspect to it. There was a little bit of malt in there, as well as some yeast. An interesting flavor, not what I was expecting. M: A highly carbonated beer with a super smooth finish. Medium-bodied.

71936,Blanco,2011-08-11,"   This is a collaboration with Tired Hands Brewing. Beer pours a dark orange, almost red color. Very cloudy. Huge fluffy white head that was difficult to keep in the glass, which only very slowly disspates and leaves some stickiness on the walls. Smells is lightly hoppy upfront. Hops are somewhat generic in that they don't smell fruity, citrusy or piney. Stronger whiffs seem more like a tripel is hiding underneath. flavor is well balanced and the hops go smoothly with the malt. Hints of fruit though dry at the same time. Flavors are hard to describe but simple. Medium bodied with slight mouthcoating. The description of the beer on the bottle is ""Belgian Ale Double IPA."" I don't really get the ""double"" out of this one, though the ABV clocks in at 7.8%. But this is what I would envision a true Belgian IPA should taste like. I've had far too many of the style that I didn't enjoy, the kind that make me feel like someone poured an IPA in my tripel, but this one truly shines.  ",4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.3

Pours a brownish hazy color with hints of red. It produces surpisingly little head that doesn't last or lace. Aroma is wheaty, a hint lemony/sour, and malty. The catch is that it is very mellow/subdued. Flavor is watery mostly but wheat, caramel, barley, and alcohol all make themselves known. But mostly watery. Low bitterness. Body is surprisingly thin and the booze that is not hidden due to lack of flavor keeps this from being overly drinkable.  ",,,,,,3

145512,ELS,2015-03-01,"   I'm a big local fan of Funky Buddha but not so much their flagship IPA Hop Gun. So, when their pineapple version first came out I was happy to taste that the pineapple really worked well with the hops much improving the overall taste. Since then I've had PHG and I'm sorry to say it's somewhat inconsistent. I write this as I'm drinking it at the brewery and notice that the smell and taste are very light on the pineapple and it definitely has some unnatural flavor. I pick up a small bit of sterilizer or cleaner that definitely detracts from the overall flavor. I had the same problem with some Last Snow on tap. I drink these beers enough to know when they are off and my only guess is that either the same person isn't making them or the quality/recipe control needs to be strengthened.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.53

Has plenty of booze to it mind you, but the barleywine dark fruits feel like they are sugar coated, and the over the top orange only adds to this feeling. Now, is this a bad thing? That is the rub, because it works for me as a sipper.... and with a glass of water near by.  ",4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.83

88861,BEERchitect,2013-01-11,"   Cask conditioned Hefeweizen you say? Conflicts are easy to imagine with this combination but the beer surprises on a few turns as the beer excedes expectations all the while. This is what microbrewing and cask experimentation is all about! Like most traditional German wheat beers, the ale starts with a hazy straw appearance and a yeasty film that's glaring. What was odd is the lumbering murk that pronounes without the support of high carbonation levels. It's result is a dull looking murky ale. Despite being an ugly duckling of an ale, its aroams as spot on. Reaching a bit further into the glass (because the spritzy carbonation does not project the aromas more strongly), the ale exhibits all the doughy, cookie sweet breadiness that is expected of a hefeweizen. Resting just above the wheat are the common fruit and spice interplay that gives German wheat beers their identity- banana and citrus balance against white pepper and clove for a distinct aromatic experience that's highly complex and inviting. Heading into taste, much of the same is expected- cookie dough sweetness is laden with yeast, fruit, and spice. Banana and tropical fruit lead the way. Although mangoes don't resonate with its unique taste, there is a non-descript fruit flavor that's not exactly ester derived and kinda takes the shape of melons and papaya. Light bubblegum, vanilla, and mint leave lasting impressions as the beers complexities seep into the taste. Now that we've celebrated the beer's aromas and flavors well, I gotta say that it's oddly light carbonation causes the beer to sit lazily on the mouth (Perhaps its because I'm not used to the flavors of hefe at the carbonation rate of cask), but the normal carbonation that gives wheat beers their ""life"" doesn't exist here and the beer's malty sweetness is felt from beginning to end and without much reprieve. But the same silky vanilla and mint flavors give the beer a silky and evaporative cooling effect that's also very charming in mouth sensations. Although I don't prefer this handling of hefeweizens, the uniqueness of the beer makes the explore these tastes in a different way. It's that kind of exploration for the brewers and the enthusiasts alike to ponder its merits. And the merits are good!  ",,,,,,3.65
329343,redresonatedragon,2018-04-17,"   Nice and frothy pour from a can, creamy and delicious foam. Strong scent of tropical jackfruits in a field of ripe mangos and citrus went well with thick haziness of this brew. Taste was very wide open in IPA county, same tropical fruits and citrus mingling with bitter piney resin so there is some initial bitter bite, but there is an underlying sweetness and enough pop in the effervescent to keep you guessing. There is also a curious tartness that comes out that is slightly distracting but also thirst quenching, I’m grabbing these later for sure  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75

Poured a full-on murky brown-yellow color, somewhere near the shade of Grey Poupon mustard, with just a thin cap of white head that no retention and extremely light lace. Damn ugly beer. The aroma was mostly fruity (kinda fake fruit, like Froot Loops) hops with no real grain or malt. The taste was pretty similar, although the fruity aspect seemed a bit more natural. The body was typical for the MurkyIPA style. Drinkability was OKish, once you get past the looks (kinda like putting a bag over someones head).

The taste was nice and hoppy, but the malts spoiled the taste of this beer a little. It was just a little too malty, I suspect this was an old bottle. Feel was nice though, fairly light with somewhat aggressive carbonation. Finish was bitter from the hops, but definitely offset by the malts.

The hop is floral and slightly earthy and far more mild than most DIPA. Oily mouthfeel from the high alcohol content which is notable for its warmth as well. The malt is masked by this.

Smells of coffee, dark chocolate, black liquorice, snow, cream, umami and soy sauce. I'm getting cherries and a fruitiness as well. As it warms, a charred bourbon comes in also. More rich chocolate notes form. Ok, my first sip of a legend. Extreme smoothness and covering of the ABV on the tongue. Smooth chocolate notes, and a light fruitiness. There's a snowy, bean quality there I also got in KBS. I get the maple syrup near the end of the palate. Snow, and the feel of maple syrup again coats the tongue. No wonder its 'C'BS. Any bourbon is extremely subdued. Smooth and oily body that rolls down the tongue. Alcohol burn is only in the throat and back of the tongue. Today I have met a legend. Could't believe my eyes finding it on the shelf at LCBO. Drinking it by frozen Lake Muskoka, December 15th, 2017.

Toffee candy and caramel scent are not quite as strong as the chocolate. On first sniff it really does smell like a cinnamon bun. Intense chocolate aroma. Distinctly reminds me of Mexican hot chocolate. The one scent I do not detect is maple syrup. Very pleasing aroma. Starts out Incredibly thick and tasty. Sweet with lots of chocolate and a big caramel and chocolate taste. Mouthfeel is off the charts. This is an honest 6 in mouthfeel. Has the same mouthfeel as hot chocolate made from straight half and half. No taste of alcohol but you sure feel it in your stomach. Slight sour taste in the after taste, lots of patent malt but it has the sweetness to handle it. Damn near perfect. Overall this is a home run knocked all the way in to the parking lot.

Aroma is deep and complex, first hitting notes of chocolate, and coffee. Next bourbon, oak, and a little bit of booziness shows through, with roasted and toasted malts bringing up the rear. Flavor profile is bourbon, which is a touch boozy, with chocolate, coffee, caramel, and a twinge of maple syrup. A bit of the 11.7% ABV shows up in the flavor. Roasted and toasted malts add to the heartiness. Mouth feel is slightly fizzy, but otherwise creamy and velvety. It has a thick consistency. Overall, a robust stout with a lot of tasty notes going on. It smells incredible right out of the bottle and freshly poured into a glass. Served in a Teku 3.0 from a 750mL bottle.  ",4.75,4.75,4.5,4.25,5,4.65
47658,polloenfuego,2017-12-15,"   This pours a deep dark black with no light getting through. There is a nice two fingers of brownish head, which slowly breaks leaving a nice cap and collar. Lacing is amazing. Smell changes as the beer warms. At first the roasts and barrel are dominant, but that nose gets sweeter as it warms, with chocolate and sweet maple coming forth. Taste follows the nose, and the warming also makes a difference here. This is a sweet beer and the maple stands out. To my taste this makes the other flavors sing a little louder to be heard...the coffee is nice on the finish, the barrel is there throughout, and the chocolate harmonizes with the maple. Feel is thick and creamy with a nice warming feel from the booze. There is good carbonation to round things out. Well, check this one off my list. It's a fantastic sipping/dessert beer. It was a hunt and destroy mission to get this beer in Ontario, 355 ml/12 oz costs $8.50...which is extremely reasonable compared to many US prices i have seen for bombers.  ",4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.69

173310,dacrza1,2018-04-27,"   DATE: April 26, 2018... OCCASION: the 2018 draft is upon us, and Cleveland drafts first and fourth--this calls for a special Victory... pours an attractive golden, crystal-clear body rife with a herd of bubbles creating a reasonable quarter-finger off-white head... the aroma sparks sherry oak, flowery hops, pepper, ginger, tea, vanilla and phenol that broaches vodka... a packed profile... sips at a biting, bitter sharpness that states its 13% with ferocity... as intense as the initial buzz occurs, the secondary mouthfeel is sheepish, soft and welcoming... its finish is respectful, fizzy and dry... as the glass drains, a smoother sherry takes over, sippable and worth holding on the tongue... unbelievably drinkable, as the sip is rewarding and wine-like... the lightness of this profile is rich in sherry, oak, dry tannins, white wine, and flowery--lilac, earthiness, oat, vanilla, and ginger all mesh to create a formidable sweetness... by its end, a buzzing strength courses through it at half-bottle... perhaps not worth its price tag, but like the Browns draft, rewarding (they chose Mayfield and Ward)...  ",3.75,4.25,4,4,4,4.05
173310,BeerAndGasMasks,2018-04-19,"   From a bottle of indeterminate age, it pours a sparkling clear golden color with a modest head, that eventually diminishes to a lusty ring and a large continent in the middle. Grass, malt and alcohol in the nose. The mouth gets a nicely flavored, somewhat boozy malt beverage. Dangerously easy to drink, however.  ",3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75

T: It tasted like lemon zest and pithy citrus, with some grassy hops and apricot and clove. It had a clean and bittersweet aftertaste with some alcohol warming. M: It was thick with moderate carbonation. Nice full body. D: This was a nice brew with complex scent and taste. Not the most delicious combination of flavors, but fun to try. The body was solid, but the finish was hot, so it was better to sip. Not for aging. Ended up more like a strong saison than a Belgian imperial IPA like I expected. Interesting but not great.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

173310,JayQue,2018-01-09,"   A very tasty beer - kind of a hybrid between a Tripel and a Quad. Pours a slightly hazy gold color with kind of an orangy cast. Small, bubbly white head shows average retention for a beer in general, but quite long for a 13% abv beer. A light covering of the top of my goblet remains for quite some time. Aroma is fruity (but has aspects of both the light fruit found in Tripels and dark fruit from Quads). Candi sugar is quite prominent as well. Taste is very good. A malty beer with strong fruit presence and some candi sugar. The sweetness is balanced (possibly by the hops - although they are probably faded by the year I have hung on to this beer). There is a fairly strong alcohol presence, more than warmness - less than a harsh alcohol ""burn"". Mouthfeel is rich and smooth with a significant alcohol presence. I would like to try one of these ""fresh"" to see how the hops blend in.  ",4,4,4.25,4,4,4.1

173310,DrDemento456,2017-07-24,   Found a bottle of this for about $9.50 at the Giant Eagle in Waterworks. Into a standard pint. Much brighter than a quad style more bright yellow with a ton of bubbles and two inches full head. Malty honey and hops on the nose with some Belgium yeast to balance. Malty grainy some fruity yeasts and just a touch of hop bitterness. Mostly surprised to get no ABV burn so the hops and malt must be balanced. Very close to their V-12. Body is pretty exceptional this bubbly brew keeps its body at medium even though the octane is heavy. Overall not a quad more of a malty triple but dry hopped to perfection. Very tasty stuff from Victory!  ,4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.2
173310,ajm5108,2017-07-24,"   Pours a bright gold with a vortex of carbonation and swirling head. Aroma has some tropical sweetness but more from phenol than any hop addition, which I would say is lacking on the nose. Flavor profile is much more aligned with a tripel or Belgian IPA (and certainly not in a Quad). Some spicey phenol, Belgian yeast - hops only show up at the end to add some bitterness but are otherwise underutilized.  ",4.5,3.5,2.75,4,3,3.21

125646,Myotus,2016-05-30,"   Poured at 50°F from a pint can (canned on 20Apr16) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Consumed on 29May16. LOOK: Three fingers to a finger within 3 minutes. Dull yellow in color with an extreme amount of cloudiness. Plethora of small rising bubbles. Lacing is subtle and very thick. SMELL: Huge aromas of mango, papaya, peach, guava, and apricot commingle with strong aromas of spicy hops, orange, grapefruit, and tangerine along with mild white bread, earthy yeast, and piney hop aromas. TASTE: Very strong flavors of mango, papaya, guava, peach, and apricot first burst on to the palate. The taste is amplified as strong piney hop, spicy hop, orange, grapefruit, and tangerine flavors immediately follow. Balance is finally achieved as mild white bread and earthy yeast along with subtle bitter hop flavors finish off the taste theatrical as all previous flavors press on. FEEL: Somewhere between full-bodied and medium-bodied. Carbonation is mild. Goes down smooth and somewhat creamy. Finishes with a strong and unpleasant dryness. NOTE: Most people who have traversed the craft universe know that Tree House does no wrong. With this being my third offering from them, I can agree--with certainty-- to that statement. I have yet to try any of their bigger brews, but I greatly look forward to those one day.  ",4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.56

The orange really jumps as the beer warms. Super light bodied for the style. No beer with this high an ABV has the right to be this smooth.

Pours a hazy copper-orange with a big 3-4 finger head which looks to be retaining to one finger of lumpy clouds and thick patches of lacing. N: Funkier than I expected, a rather bitter smell, lots of pine resin and some malt is present. Not a lot of citrus or tropics... T: Very nice! One of those IPA's that don't smell nearly as good as they taste. This is a refreshing IPA Kicker with lots of tropical fruit, citrus, and a perfect grapefruit bitterness aftertaste that my nose was just not picking up...pleasant surprise. And at 93 IBU it's dangerously smooth and drinkable, not too aggressive, just perfect. This is a real treat! M: Kind of thin, with just below average carbonation which makes it even easier to taste the juicy fruitiness of this IPA. Goes down really smooth and easy, can't even tell it's 8% O: Very very very good, been looking forward to trying this and I'm very pleased. I'm a fan of simple malt, I've tried almost all their entire collection and this is hands down the best they do. This ranks alongside Le Castor Yakima IPA, and Dieu du Ciel Moralite for the best IPA's made in Quebec. If you live outside of Quebec and come across this....Buy ALL of them!!!  ",4,3.5,5,4.75,4.5,4.46

137375,ludachris,2014-10-23,"   Its golden amber body has a touch of haze. Bubbles in what looks like hundreds of streams jet to the top where almost three fingers of dense, creamy white head forms. Sheets of honeycomb lace appear as the head recedes. The nose is an elegant bed of summer fruit. There's layers of peaches and apricots, mangos and papaya. It's juicy and ripe with no real sign of anything else. Like so few other beers do, the nose serves as an identical template for the taste. It's a bit different for a IIPA in that the bite of bitterness comes first and then I'm slapped with heaps of tropical fruit which actually linger past the finish. The peaches and mangoes are perfectly sweet and are really the center of this.Dry pine needles creep into the finish as well but by no means are the intrusive. It's lusciously creamy, giving its fruitiness some density. Its below average carbonation helps to pull the juicy sweetness through. For 93 IBU's this is ridiculously, unbelievably, unhealthily easy to drink. It doesn't help that its 8% ABV goes almost unnoticed. I will forever be a sucker for fruit forward IPA's. My bias towards these IPA's and the hops that go into making them doesn't entirely make up for its near perfect score. This is very well crafted. From its creamy feel to its potent aroma to how well its IBU content is hidden, everything balances out and the transitions from feels and flavors are seamless. This not only sits right with DDC's Moralite and Le Castor's Yakima for the best Canadian made IPA I've had to date, it's one of the best IPA's I've had in my life. What a treat.  ",,,,,,5

The flavor profile is complex, yet the flavors are subtle - consists of coffee, booze, hints of bourbon and coconut, and hints of oak. It is sweet but not overly so. I was amazed at how the flavors were so subtle and balanced. The coffee stood out to me the most, but it still was not overpowering. I didn't pick up on much maple flavor it was just a little sweet. The feel was a little thinner than expected and slick. Not very carbonated - I liked the feel. Overall, it was a pleasure to obtain a couple bottles of this beer and to me it lived up to the hype.

Mouthfeel is smoooooooth, kind of creamy. Alcohol is well hidden but will sneak up and bite you in the butt. Hence the long-suffering designated driver. Finish is as good as the first sip.

Cirtus fruits, papaya, apple, grass, pepper, tropical bubblegum, with big rich malt wave coming in at the finish. Spectacular.

That is probably the key. It was recommended to me and I'll have to go thank them in person. Great looking, only good smelling. Spectacular taste to it with wave after wave of sweet, juicy fruits. It almost feels like Heady to me in that I can feel the hop flavors transition. All this undercut with an earthy hop presence and a washing wave of caramel malt and clean citrus at the end. It feels nice and is highly drinkable. Will hopefully have again soon; worth looking for, just be sure to check the date : ) (4.5) **To be sure, I may be having an off day with my nose (though it isn't congested).

125646,BEERchitect,2016-05-12,"   With the balance of pale ale but with the complexity, intensity and strength of imperial ale, Tree House brewers push the limits on hop aroma and flavor while keeping the bitter-to-sweet ratio a little closer to even-keel. Once again, the New England-style IPA rears its ugly head with the murk of a mud puddle and looks like the tarnish gold of vegemite. A plethora of citrus, tropical and orchard fruits churn from the dense ecru froth and entice the nose with promises of fruit, tartness and bittersweetness. Honey, caramel and crusty key-lime pie come to mind as the ale creeps onto the tongue. Its bright fruit bouquet transitions to taste immediately with red grapefruit, tangerine, nectarine, pineapple, mango, passionfruit, lime, lemon and kiwi. Canteloupe and a berry-like tang rounds out the fruitiness of the esters and hops while the persestent sweetness within coats the middle palate with layers of fructose, angel-food cake and succulent honey. As the ale turns to take a bitter stride, the taste of fresh shavings of pine and sassafras weave in to command the sweetness with a fresh grassiness, herbal dankness and a curious taste of cannabis. Medium-full in body, the beer's imperial heft keeps the ale richer and fuller, and resists any convincing turn to dryness, bitterness or elevated crispness. What the palate gets in return is the full malt balance that gives the hops a more rounded and more complex flavor. An aftertow of herb and citrus have a warm alcohol spice counterpart in a long cream-sickle finish.  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.46

125646,fmccormi,2016-05-10,"   Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (TH stemware, for those curious). There’s a canning date of May 2, 2016 printed in black ink on the underside of the can, which reads “KEEP COLD 05 02 16 SUHH DUDE”—which would make this five days old at the time of consumption. This was purchased at the brewery on the 4th, and it immediately went into the fridge so these are essentially ideal tasting circumstances. Appearance (4.5): Two very full fingers of creamy, custard-colored foam rise happily off of the pour, capping a cloudy, orange and honey-colored body. The head dies down relatively slowly, leaving scattered suds near the peak of the head, a half-finger collar, and a diminutive clump of foam near the center. As the body goes down, it leaves a solid sheath of foam on the far side of the glass, with peaks and valleys in its profile. Smell (4.5): Positively pungent, nectar-like citrus dominates the nose: musky papaya flesh, sticky mango juice, and passion fruit. It blends smoothly with sugar cookie-like sweetness, country bread, and earthy tones paired with a slightly grassy aroma. A dank, weedy note brings up the rear. As it warms, it shifts more toward passion fruit and sauvignon blanc-like gooseberry notes, as well as a much stronger musk. This is seriously excellent stuff. Taste (4.5): This shit is bonkers. I’m not entirely sure what’s going on here, honestly—it starts off with a combination of papaya muskiness and a kind of earthy, bready component. A little bit of guava and strawberry come out, followed by passion fruit, a limeade mix of citric tartness and light, balancing sweetness, and pink grapefruit flesh with sugar sprinkled on top. A grassy note mixes in at this point, making for a slightly cannabis-like feel. All throughout, a layer of sugar cookie sweetness tempers any bitterness, helping to accentuate the fruitiness of it all. Amazingly, there’s no noticeable booziness in the flavor, thought a slight spiciness does come up in the finish. Mouthfeel (4.25): Smooth, slick, and somewhat on the full- side of medium-weight, with a juicy, nectar-like feel. Still, the oily hop presence dries out the feel significantly just as the beer finishes. All throughout, the carbonation is fine-grained, subtle, and smooth, matching the body’s thickness with its creamy feel. The alcohol appears here just a bit, with a boozy dryness that blends in with the hop bitterness. Smooth and satisfying, with a feel that matches its heft and hop load. Overall (4.5): This is, in the end, an outstanding, smooth, supremely fruity, satisfying DIPA. This is, effectively, New England-style hop juice, and there’s not an unpleasant thing about it, but it does lack some of the depth and complexity of my very favorite DIPAs. NOT THAT I AM COMPLAINING FOR EVEN A SECOND—just explaining what might separate this from the most world-class of world-class DIPAs. This is still, in every single way, an absolute joy to drink. I’m guessing it goes without saying . . . but this is highly recommended.  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.48

47658,Thomas_Wikman,2017-12-12,"   I finally got to drink Founders' CBS, an Imperial Breakfast Stout brewed with chocolate and coffee, maple syrup, brewed in bourbon barrels, ABV 11.7%. Was it as good as the hype, yes I pretty much think so. I was surpised by how smoth it was. Look: jet-black with a two-inch mocca head. Aroma: roasted malts, chocolate, bourbon Taste: It's all there chocolate; lots of chocolate, coffee, a little syrupy sweetness, bourbon. However, it is all well balanced into a creamy, flavorful, yet non-aggressive but inviting flavor, and the alcohol despite the 11.7% is barely noticeable.

47658,Scotchboy,2017-12-11,"   Finally on-tap near me in Boise, at the Bier:Thirty bottle shop. Served in a snifter. Really beautiful but still normal-looking stout, opaque with a very large, dense & foamy off-khaki head that really stuck around. Nose has prominent sweetness, chocolate, roast, some spirit character, and the palate follows that nicely. Really not cloying at all, though the sweetness is upfront. The only thing I can really dock any points over was the expectation of a little more coffee presence for a 'breakfast'-style beer, though I wouldn't want overpowering coffee notes in a beer like this. Still, a little more would have made it perfect. Also, the sweetness seemed to cut the mouthfeel just slightly, though the stout body was thick and creamy with perfect lower carbonation. Awesome stuff and really happy it made it to the 208.  ",5,4.75,4.75,4.75,5,4.82

Intoxicating aromas of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, browned butter, bourbon, and just a hint of maple syrup. Everything melds together on the palate, creating an extremely deep and complex flavor profile. Sweet, yes, but not cloying, with a touch of roasted malt bitterness on the finish that lends balance. A brilliantly conceived, bar-setting imperial stout.  ",4.5,5,5,4.75,4.75,4.9

Consumed over a 7 hour period (!) beginning from slightly chilled to room temp of 68 degrees. I'll be curious to see how the rest of my bottles develop over the next 1-2 years. Update 2-13-18: Had on tap at Lures Bar & Grille and I'm slightly raising my rating (from 4.24 to 4.37). On tap there is more maple and less alcohol heat (none at all really). Still not much bourbon and not a ton of coffee or chocolate. Delicious beer but still not quite living up to the hype for me.  ",4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.37

At first you got a chocolate explosion but as it warmed, the chocolate subsided and the other ingredients came through. Strong Woody notes from the barrel with some alcohol heat and maple sweetness. The coffee also starts to show itself but it melds beautifully with the chocolate. The nose on this beer is serious. The taste does not entirely live up to the nose though. The complexities of the nose do not translate as the taste is flat with chocolate and alcohol predominating. A little bit of maple sweetness lingers on the back end. It is a tad more carbonated than I ordinarily enjoy but it is silky. This beer is like chocolatey maple candy. Overall this is a very good beer that actually has lots of balance.  ",4.25,4.75,4,4,4.25,4.25

Definitely a pale quad or triple look. Smell is malt, light bread, then grain and maybe some sweeter sugars; hops are noticeable but not dominant. Taste is that of an amped up clean triple (not spiced like golden monkey). Malt is very lightly toasted, then grain, then sweeter adjunct. Hops are neutral at first and somewhat overtaken by the strength and malt, though the bitterness shines through at the finish. As it warms some lighter notes of grapefruit, pineapple, earthy notes are present. ABV is not necessarily noticeable at first but the strength catches up and numbs the tongue some. Mouthfeel is sweet at first, then bitter, then lightly numbing - all good transitions and expected from a hoppy/semidry/strong ale. Overall this is a beer that hids its strength very well - though it does start warm you up. Flavors are fairly neutral and not out of balance, though I might say the hops are knocked down by the strength a bit. It holds well in the mouth and finishes well - a little dangerous as a large format.  ",3.75,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,3.85

There is a strong mix of peaches and some low citrus mixed in. Taste: The flavors bring out the peaches with a complex mixture from the barnyard and leather. There is a low background note of grain and citrus. It also has a low sherry like element with it. Feel: In spite of the ABV it has a moderate body. The aftertaste is moderately bitter with the earthly elements intertwined. It has strong alcohol warming, but it not hot. Overall, this is a complex Belgian ale with strength that is easy to consume because of the lack of a hot alcoholic feel to it.  ",4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4.24
173310,Lone_Freighter,2017-06-06,"   This was poured into a chalice. The appearance was a bit different expected for a quad, but then again I see in the margin, it’s a Belgian Strong ale. Golden in color with a thin white wisp of a level head. Minimal semi-foamy lacing. The smell takes on sweet tropical fruits, peaches, light grassiness blending nicely. Slight citrus pulp. The taste takes all of those aromas to wrap in and out of each other in a decent dry fashion. Definitely a dry citrus aftertaste and quick semi-boozy finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a crisp sweet sessionable feel to it. Carbonation runs fairly light. Overall, for a quad, I say nope. Definitely closer to a Belgian Strong ale and because of the semi-light body, could be a decent one with its respected food.  ",3.75,4,3.75,4,4,3.89

I first noticed that it was rather light on color for a Quad, though I have seen others looking similar on rare occasion. My tulip was filled with a clear, medium-to-deep golden colored brew. Carbo was scattered, and the head was a frothy, fluffy dollop of white foam, leaving excellent stick in the glass. Body was medium, and it was quite smooth on the tongue. Had some bready, dough-like malt character at the outset. Also showing up was a bit of cotton-candy sweetness; some tropical fruity action - mango, pear and melon; and some honeyish notes. Rounding things out were some citrussy hops and some warming alcohol. Quite the different Quad, but quite the tasty one. Well done, Victory!!

173310,mothmanscott,2016-12-18,"   Poured into a St. Bernards goblet the brew is a pale amber producing little more than a finger of off-white, foamy, short-lived head that recedes to a filmy surface cap & thin collar ring that leaves no lacing. The color is very pale for the style. Aroma is a bready pale malt, dough, Belgian candy sugar sweet & a heady hop presence of tropical fruit orange, pineapple, melon & resinous pine, with some subdyed herbal/floral hints combining with notes of spice, alcohol & yeasty white fruit esters. Taste is lacking the malty profile associated with the style being more pale & doughy with a deficit of richer malt, toffee & dark fruit with the pineapple, orange, pine, earthy/dank & melon hop notes coming to the forefront. Spice, alcohol, a sweet apple, pear & honey undertone commingle in the background. The finish rapidly transitions to more pine resin & bitter citrus with the bitter becoming dominant in the dry tropical fruit/citrus/pine, dough, warm alcohol aftertaste. The balance is also divergent for the style as I'm sure you have already gleaned from my description. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, slick, lightly syrupy & chewy, a little peppery but overall smooth & silky on the tongue with a dry aftertaste. ??To my senses this is overall more in line with a Belgian IPA or certian DIPAs or a TIPA with characteristics of a BSPA.

125646,Unfiltered413,2016-05-08,"   Had from 2 day old growler obtained at TH Brewery One of my all-time favorite beers Tree House brews. Pours a hazy orange like most Tree House IPA's are know for but not as thick in appearance as say their Julius is. As other reviewers have said it drinks like a beer with a much lower ABV (8.2). Tons of lacing and the ever present aroma of orange, mango and peach. Just and amazing all around beer.  ",4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,4.85

Smell is tropical fruit, orange & grapefruit. Taste is bitter but citrusy, just like other TH beers. The Bitterness lingers. It's tingly & sharp. As I drink I notice there's a lot of settling happening with a lot dropping out to bottom of glass. I think this is fine but overrated.  ",3.25,4.5,4,3.75,3.75,4

125646,Slatetank,2016-05-04,"   thanks so much to tenderbranson69 for sharing this -from the can in a tulip chilled. I had taken a long walk and this slaked my thirst in just the right way. The color is like fresh pressed juice with white head and fine bead with lots of lace clinging in rings with good retention. The smell is so juicy-you might believe there is actual fruit in this - very tropical! the smell has a citrus quality with lemony and lightly grassy zesty smell that brings out herbal and subtle stone fruit accents. The feel is great - fruity and tangy with medium carbonation and semi-sweet entry yet juicy tangy and bitter balances out with a semi-dry yet very light astringent aspect with a long hop finish. The taste is as great as the smell hints at just a lovely mix of sweet citrus and tropical fruit flavors in the hops with a very mild malt to supplement that juicy taste and soft bitter accent with a more herbal/sweetgrass taste in the back with malt and bitterness more balanced in order that there is no alcohol in the taste. Overall I found this to be smooth, drinkable fresh and lively as far as the intensity of the hop flavor and it is very quaffable for a 8.2% beer I was able to sip and enjoy this very easily looking forward to future tastes of this fine brew.  ",4,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.55

It has good citrus smells and flavor with a slightly dank bitter aftertaste which again is good but not great. There are so many breweries that aren't hyped up nearly as much as TH that do it better (for example Cellarmaker). Other than Julius, which is an excellent yet one dimensional juice bomb, I don't see why everyone is going so ape shit over this brewery.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

125646,TheDoctor,2016-05-01,"   Serving: Can Canned: Mar-30-2016 (Consumed Apr-30) Thanks, KC! Pours a cloudy pale gold with a big, billowing white foam cap that sticks around very well, big globs and rings of lacing. The aroma is a mix of juicy melon, orange, mango, pungent green hops and a biscuity malt backbone. The flavor is right on the smell's heels but a lot oilier and stankier as far as the hops are concerned; orange pith, grapefruit, soft mango flavors, melon and a final wave of dank, resinous hop cone oiliness. Medium body, active carbonation, fairly drinkable with a lingering sappy/sweaty finish. This is a very good beer that I throughly enjoyed. It has a little something that sets it aside from other IPAs from TH as well as other beers that I have had. I could just describe it as sweaty. Both in taste and smell is is fruity, it is juicy, it is resinous, but there is a lingering undercurrent of a pungent, almost-sharp tang of funky dank hop stank. It is good, but it is also the one thing that keeps it from being more drinkable for me, especially since it is tied to the bitter oily finish. Fabulous beer. I would definitely have it again.  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.46

47658,MacMalt,2017-12-10,"   2017 Release. Poured into Founders pint glass. It poured nearly ink black with deep mahogany hues when held to the light, and almost two full fingers of lovely, fluffy, mocha-colored head and lacing that dissipated very slowly leaving thick, elegant lacing. The nose featured dark roasted malt, both burnt and freshly-brewed coffee, chocolate, and just a whiff of maple. Surprisingly, I didn't smell the bourbon. I could certainly taste the maple syrup, however. When first sipped it was extremely sweet - but the taste quickly changed to burnt coffee, char, and dark chocolate. Only at the finish did I finally notice the bourbon taste. Initially, it was almost like sipping two distinct beers. As the glass warmed, however, the sweetness became less pronounced and the bourbon more distinct. This stout has a rich, creamy mouth feel with moderate carbonation, and I could really feel the 11.7% ABV. For me, as for many others, CBS has been a whale for years and I was pleased that New Jersey finally received bottles this year. While initially I was a little put off by the sweetness, as the glass warmed the flavors blended really nicely and I now understood why CBS is so highly regarded. It's not the best stout I've ever had (I'd pick Parabola any time) but it's awfully good!  ",4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.54

47658,mschrei,2017-12-10,"   1,000th rated beer calls for something extra special. Three words come to mind with this beer: flavor, balanced, subtle. Just fantastic. It's funny-after the first few drinks, I was wondering what the big deal was, but as I continued, it just seemed to get better and better. Look is dark as can be, nice foam and head retention. Smell is coffee, chocolate, and maple, but not overwhelming, slight hints of barrel there as well. Taste is wow. Just plain wow. So much flavor – chocolate, coffee, maple, all over a robust roasty stout base. It's sweet without being cloying or sticky. A very smooth feel. For a beer at almost 12% ABV, you can hardly tell. There is just a slight hint of slick oiliness that is the only weakness overall. But I admire the contrast of complexity and subtlety so much that I really have to give it fives across the board. One of the best beers I think I've ever had. So glad to try it, and a very worthy 1000th beer to rate.  ",5,5,5,5,5,5

173310,StonedTrippin,2016-10-25,"   couple of points on this on. first of all, its really pale, hazy blonde at its darkest, and predictably at this color, lacks some of the malt depth the style is known for. i really found it to be a little one dimensional in terms of the grain here, the deeper, sweeter, fruity, richer notes just arent here, so its more of a belgian strong ale than a quad as most of us know them. second, i probably shouldnt have let this sit in the cellar for so long. about a year old not, a lot of the hops have apparently faded, and only bitterness remains, exacerbated by slight oxidation, i didnt get the citrusy mosaic or citra at all hardly. third, i wouldnt reccomend taking one of these down by yourself! the 13% is surprisingly well hidden, and it sneaks right up on me, definitely didnt need the whole one last night! some cool flavors in here still, green apple, grassy hops, white wine, pear, and a cool picy belgian yeast strain that obviously worked hard in its prime. a neat beer, maybe mislabeled as a quad, but something a little different as far as american made belgian style ales are concerned. beautifully effervescent carbonation. i will have to try this one fresh and see how the hops are. i think they would have made it way more dynamic. on me for ageing it too long...  ",3.75,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,3.63

Belgian-style fermentation and impressive American hops make this light bodied ale intense, inviting and entirely unique. Enjoy Hoppy Quad and Taste Victory!"" Brewed in the style of a Belgian Quadrupel brewed with Cascade, Chinook, Citra and Mosaic hops. Available in 750ml. bottles and on limited draft. Poured from a 750ml. bottle to a tulip glass. (Appearance) Pours a crisp frothy head of a creamy white tone over a very clear pale amber body with subtle haziness and very light carbonation. Retention is average and there is no visible carbonation. Unusually bright and pale for a Quadrupel. 3.25 (Smell) Aromatic hop notes of citrus peel, dank pine and tropical fruit pulp atop a delicate malt body of light breadiness and pale malt grains with a moderate sweetness. Very accessible and inviting aroma, again very out-of-place for a Quadrupel. 3.75 (Taste) Rich, residual malt body with juicy fruit notes is seamlessly complimented with a bouquet of hop flavors; tropical fruits, citrus pith and dank herbal notes elevate the perceived body of this beer to a very desirable level. The flavor swings a bit pale and light on darker fruit notes than a Quadrupel usually does, but there's no mistaking this beer has a sizable body and a lot of malt depth, even if the focus is on the hop profile overall. 4 (Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, moderately residual, lightly chewy, slightly syrupy, mildly dry. Carbonation is mild, generating a mild frothiness and a modestly crisp finish. Body is light/medium for the style and medium+ overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to hoppy bitter and smooth grain alcohol. Alcohol presence is modest and there are no off characters. 3.75 (Overall) This beer comes off as difficult to categorize, but I would likely not have chosen Quadrupel over more appropriate choices of Tripel, Belgian Strong Pale or even a ""Belgian"" Imperial IPA, all of which seem fitting for this beer. It's challenging to rate a beer based on the style, as this beer does not nearly come through a Quadrupel, and thus does not pass on the ""true-to-style"" front. That aside, this beer is highly drinkable and very enjoyable with an incredible range of hop character that nicely compliments a smooth, but ultimately bold and deceptively high gravity malt body. It is a bit sweeter than the traditional Imperial IPA but works incredibly well. I would love to see this repackaged in a 4 pack format, and think it is one of Victory's best 750's out there. 3.75 Victory Brewing Company's Hoppy Quad 3.82/5.00  ",3.25,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.82

173310,rajendra82,2016-03-26,"   The beer was picked up in an elegant 750 ml bomber with a cork and cage cap. The label was also well designed with hop cones in a arrangement of fours (quad). While the packaging was authentic looking, the pour was anything but. Don't get me wrong, this was a very good looking beer, but it looked exactly like a BSPA, with a golden body and constant stream of bubbles, and not at all dark red and quiet like a Quadrupel. The smell of the beer was a nice mix of grapefruit and pine from the American hops, and aromas of the Belgian yeast derived spices like white pepper and cinnamon. The taste was much closer to a Quadrupel than the looks and smell indicated. I could detect a lot of sweetness from the malt, which tasted like cherry, melon, and pineapple. The hops were more in support in the flavor, but they showed up in the finish, and their tropical flavors played off against the yeast spiciness well. Despite all that sweetness, the bitterness seemed to break through mid palette before fading again. The body was quite thick, and the beer was warming, but not quite to the level expected from such a high ABV. This was good find, and a nicely enjoyable example of what a Belgian Double+ IPA would be.  ",4,4.5,4.25,4,4.5,4.32

Rich and sweet caramel malt flavors; heavy, ripe, yellow stone fruit notes; dull yet somewhat heavy boozy quality; low-key hop bitterness. Heavy body; vinous, almost oily. A strange yet wonderful off-shoot of the Belgian quadruple style. It delivers a lot of malt sweetness (yet not too heavy or cloying) along with the heavy body expected from the style. Most of the hop character seems to reside within the aroma although there is a fine, easy edge that nicely tempers the rich sweetness. Deep and complex flavors with a full-bodied mouthfeel. It's not your average quad and stands apart, in a good way, from most...  ",3.75,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,3.9

Pours a very hazy, nearly opaque caramel orange with a two finger white head that dissipates to a thick cap with thick lacing. Aroma of lightly caramel pale malt, citrus and tropical fruit hops, grapefruit, lemon, orange, passionfruit, guava and a little dankness. Flavor is pale malt with a hint of caramel, citrus and dank hops, lemon, orange, cantelope, passionfruit, grapefruit rind. Finishes with good dry hop resinous hops with lingering grapefruit rind and lemon and orange esters. Medium bodied with ligth creaminess and nice mouth feel. I'm still on the fence with NE style IPAs, and the first taste of this was ""not enough hop bitterness"". But this IPA grew on me very quickly and oddly, I was getting more lingering hop bitterness as I drank the first glass. There are some really nice herbal and dank hop flavors that reveal themselves over the taste and as the glass progresses. This was a winner for someone not enthused by the style.

The taste is a bit more expansive- Wild Turkey, oak, malt, light vanilla, light bitter chocolate, some alcohol. Smooth, a good medium to full body, lighter level of carbonation. Extremely barrel forward. It’s not complex, there’s not a lot going on besides the barrels, but somehow it still works pretty well. My only negative would be the price point. This was only a couple of months in the bottle- think it was well over a year in the barrel, so maybe aging would have helped.  ",,,,,,4

Beige froth & creamy head show fairly good retention & leaves some lacing on sides. A thin lasting layer persists on top. Intense caramel, yeast, slight sulfur & salty notes, solvent hues to the nose & fudge chocolate on the back. Sweet, herbal & caramel malt at first sip. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Velvety palate. Malty & biscuit in the middle but slight herbal, chocolate touch & light fruit avoid cloyingness from a sweet finish. Hops gently arise on the long & dried aftertaste to provide freshness & drinkability in front of alcohol heat. As it warms solvent-like hints fade & chocolate hues increases.

Smell is heavy on tart passion fruit, with some floral hops and cocoa nibs present. Taste has a stronger cocoa nibs flavor that works surprisingly well with the tart fruit base. The lactose is subtle and adds good balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy up front with a tart and effervescent finish, sourness is on point. Overall this beer surprised me in how good it is. Although it is expected for Creature to not produce a very good Berliner, the cocoa nibs worked surprisingly well. Also, the dry hops were a nice complement to the tart base, just a delicious and complex beer. Hopefully they brew it again.  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.6

Nice hoppy aroma could be detected from a significant distance, notes of citrus pith and rind, pine, stone fruits. The flavor was a bit more aggressive than your typical TH IPA, in that the hop bitterness seemed more assertive. Lots of hops, citrus pith, grapefruit, lime, pine resin, kiwi, peach, bitter and dry, with a grainy rye finish. Nice. Mouthfeel, again, quite drying, crisp, medium in body, easily drinkable, a hop-head's delight.

Some molasses and brown sugar behind the hops on the nose. This beer goes down wayy too nicely for being 13%. Bubbly, but with a syrupy smooth mouthfeel going down. Sweet, but not cloying given the abv. The fruity hoppiness is balanced well by the candy-like Belgian malt, giving this beer a very juicy character. A very nice quad with an interesting twist on the American hops. Tastes like a Belgian imperial IPA. A real treat of a beer.  ",4.25,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.29
173310,Slatetank,2016-01-22,   I tried this on tap at Federal Taphouse served chilled in a glass. The color is a beautiful golden with thick white head with fine bead and mild hazed clarity. The smell is very fragrant with both hops and yeast phenollics with a citrus/tropical odor and slight malt in the nose with sweet aroma. The feel is a little odd -full bodied with moderately sweet texture yet moderately bitter with lower than average carbonation for a belgian style -resinous with a semi-sweet finish w ith slight alcohol and bitterness lingering The taste has the hop profile of an American IPA yet there is certainly belgian yeast flavor there with a depth of malt that is not quite bready or sweet but there is a noticeable alcohol presence in the taste. This is a strange mash-up of Belgian Quad and American IPA/Strong ale that has to be tasted to be understood -it has a good amount of hop flavor but as far as the style of Quad goes it really only has the belgian yeast/alcohol in common with that. I liked it for what its worth.  ,4.25,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.72

The beer looks much more like a tripel over a ""traditional"" quad. The color is a pale amber with a thin wisp of white foam on the surface. Plenty of carbonation from the glass and the cork gave a very satisfying pop when pulled. Nose: dank hops, fruity and strong. Very tropical, mango, pineapple, citrus, lemony, oranges, ripe fruit. Some alcohol. Taste: very hot and strong although it drinks very light for a 13% atom bomb. The tropical hops carry through to the finish. The beer is on the thinner side of things but it is nice. Crisp and fruity finish. Overall: what an interesting offering from Victory. Not at all a traditional quad but very enjoyable in the end. Because of the hop character I'd say that they want this one to be drank fresh however I do believe it will stay a while in the cellar. Very nice beer.  ",3.25,4.25,4,4,4,4.02

47658,morimech,2017-12-09,"   2017 year as with any coffee beer, best drank very fresh. Thick black appearance with two fingers of head that slowly settles leaving behind plenty of lacing. Disappointing aroma and it is very weak. I do pick up notes of coffee, roasted malt, and faint booze. The beer picks up in the flavor however. I get bitter chocolate, vanilla, coffee, faint bourbon, and then the maple syrup adds flavor and sweetness in the finish. I definitely would of liked more bourbon notes in the beer as it is barely distinguishable. When the maple syrup comes through in the finish you also notice the effects it has on the body. Thick and luscious mouthfeel. Nice soft carbonation. A very good beer but hardly mind blowing or being a quintessential beer in todays market.  ",4.5,3.75,4.25,5,4.25,4.22

47658,scootny,2017-12-09,"   On tap at The Three Monkeys in nyc. Tight dark head and good lacing. Sticky fluid clubs almost as much as the foam. Dark liquid suck in light and never lets go. Nose carries such a message of aromas that are so well integrated it's a deep puzzle separating them. Coffee hits first with an underlay of chocolates. Plural. Milk and bakers. Roasted malts and burnt sugars. Light maple. A hint of barrel. Earthy hops. Taste is a follow-up. Sweet and complex. Coffee, chocolate, maple. Bourbon gives light but firm kisses. Faint oak and cherries. Finish is mildly bitter and somewhat shorter and cleaner than I would expect for such a big beer on this style. A mild nuttiness lingers with the touch of maple and bourbon. Feel is the benchmark for this style. Thick and creamy while remaining light and supple. You almost don't want to swallow out feels so good in your mouth. But you do and you love it. This is possibly the best imperial stout I've had. It's that good. It's certainly in my top five. Outstanding!  ",4.25,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75

47658,BenHoppy,2017-12-09,"   So here it is, the legendary CBS in my possession at last. Put in fridge for 20 mins then served in snifter: Look is beautifully dark with a thin enticing lacing. The smell is maple and bourbon. But flavors are of bourbon, maple, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, coconut, toffee, coffee, oak, and hops. The maple isn't in your face as it comes from the barrel,and it's like it's brewed in a barrel that brewed FBS, KBS, maple syrup, CBS, and then Bliss hot sauce; can sort of sense it. It's almost like it got brewed in a barrel that has had its extended use. Great beer, but I'd prefer KBS. It has similarity to KBS with added maple but with staler bourbon although the bourbon in it is still delicious just seems a bit stickier vintage than in KBS. Either way glad to have tried it. I'd also suggest forget about the 20 mins in fridge just serve room temperature as long as you don't live in warm climate as it gets better the more it sits. It is easily drinkable, heavy feel yet super smooth, soft, and silky. It's worth trying at least once.  ",5,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.65

Retention is excellent and there are intricate patterns of webbed lacing all over the glass. Smell is orange, grapefruit, pineapple and dankness. Absolutely incredible. Taste is the same with a bit of bitterness on the finish. Feel is light side of medium, soft and juicy with a sticky finish. Overall this beer is absolutely immaculate.

285583,Damian,2018-02-26,"   Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Mystic Brewery, Chelsea, MA 02/16/2018 Served in a tulip Outstanding appearance. The cloudy, apricot colored body was topped by a finger-tall, super tight and creamy, eggshell colored crown. Fantastic lacing. Drippy rings and streaky patches trickled down the sides of the glass and stuck around until the beer was finished. The aroma was solid but less exciting than I anticipated initially. Citrus was most apparent. Juicy orange notes dominated. Some tangerine too. Bit of honey-like sweetness. As the beer sat, the nose really intensified. Big melon notes appeared. Cantaloupe came through strong. Loads of honeydew as well. Dank, weedy notes were also detectable. Touch of peach and nectarine. The flavor profile was really hoppy and fairly sweet. Big citrus hop presence. Juicy orange notes came through strongest. Some candied orange peel perhaps as well. Peach notes were also apparent. The beer was anchored by a rich, sweet, malty backbone. With time, melon notes appeared and really intensified. Loads of cantaloupe and honeydew. Touch of peach. There was a dank, weedy quality too. The beer finished with more candied orange peel, a hint of bitterness and a kiss of alcohol. Nice rich, fuller bodied mouthfeel. Slightly syrupy. Creamy and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, frothy, tongue coating effervescence. Triple IPAs often have a tendency to be very malt forward, and this one stayed just shy of being overly sweet. Post Apocalyptic Xanadu is a really nicely done beer that became significantly more punchy and complex as it warmed. Be patient with this one.  ",4.75,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.55

Notes of ripe melon, papaya, guava, green mango, pineapple, and peach. Heavy and sticky on the nose. Taste: Aggressively juicy hops on the attack. Notes of papaya, grapefruit, guava, and pineapple. Then a second burst of hops hits in the body with more papaya, peach, and nectarine notes. This runs its course as a note of sweet honey malt gets slowly revealed then recedes to a lightly bitter dry finish. Feel: Medium plus body. Juicy and resinous on the palate. Soft carbonation. Deceptively smooth given the ABV. Mild alcohol warmth. Dry finish. Mild bitterness. Overall: A stellar offering from Mystic. It’s absolutely bursting with juicy citrus hops in soft smooth package.

Aroma is pilsner and pale malts with herbal and floral hop notes. Straight forward ""beer"" aroma. Flavor profile is intriguing, with pilsner, pale, and bread malts opening it up. It develops a ""wet-dog"" note, before decaying into a bitter hop finish. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a slightly effervescent feel.

It does go thin but it's almost like it melts in the mouth and nearly dissolves. No after taste. Super smooth. T: creamy malt, grain, honey, barley, and lemon. Slightly bitter. O: best pilsner ever had hands down. Don't understand the low reviews. Maybe was poured in wrong glass and/or served too cold? This is German beer brewed with purity law. Sure it's not some crazy craft beer fad but it's brilliantly brewed for a pilsner. To give low score is almost like what did you expect? Why buy? This is German beer they will all be quite similar.

125646,nhindian,2016-04-28,"   Canned 4/20/2016. Can saying: ""Alright x 3"". I can dig the Matthew McConaughey reference. Appearance - Living up to its name, Haze is... hazy. This is pretty much the de facto description of the appearance for all Tree House IPAs so far. It seems to be a little lighter in appearance than either Julius or Sap. The head is very foamy and long-lasting. Aroma - The nose brimming with juicy notes from the fresh hops and the peach aroma is through the roof. A pulpy orange note follows next like a glass of freshly-squeezed O.J. and just the faintest hint of pine at the end. Taste - Finally, a Tree House beer that tastes as good as it smells. The hops are obviously the most dominant flavor here, but it is all juicy goodness; there is almost no bitterness at all despite the high alcohol and hop dosage. Again, I'm getting tons of peach, orange, pine sap, and other tropical fruits that it's pretty crazy actually. Perhaps a tiny bit of malt backbone as well, but who needs it when the hops carry the flavor as well as this does? Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with good carbonation. Tree House nails the body perfectly once again, with a soft texture that accentuates the hops. This is probably the lightest DIPA I've had. Closing Arguments - Overall, this is far-and-away the best Tree House beer I've had so far that I could actually sit down with and analyze. Lights On may give it a run for its money, but that was at a tasting, so different circumstances there. Whereas Julius and Sap didn't live up to their billing, Haze carries the standard and doesn't relinquish it in the flavor. If I had this blind, there's no way I'd peg it as anywhere close to 8%. Dangerously crushable for sure.  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.74

S- wonderful. papaya, mango, tropical, very very strong nose. T - the beer does not sip as strong fruity forward as the smell as the bite at the end is bitter and lingers. Lots of resiny earthy pine in the finish that lingers long. almost so much so that it overpowers everything else though the more you drink it the more the other notes come off the sidelines and take hold. F - does not feel like 8.2 at all, light, fluffy. very good here. O - this is my first crack at tree house and it is very very good. almost a jeckyl and hyde type situation where the smell is so citrus and the finish is so earthy dank but they pull it together nicely. the more you sip it the more you get from it too. great stuff.  ",5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.32

47658,invertalon,2017-12-09,"   Poured from a bottle into a Spiegelau Stout Glass. Aroma: Bold coffee, roast sweetness, oak/bourbon and faint alcohol. No maple detected. Appearance: Dark black, impressive mocha/tan head. Lacing persists as you drink. Looks really nice! When swirled, nice viscous look. Taste: Coffee is bold and dominant. Followed by roast malt and medium sweetness. Not much maple detected until the very end on the palate, but its quite subtle. Has a fairly harsh roast/bitter lingering on the finish. You get the oak and bourbon, but it's fairly restrained and nice. Feel: Medium bodied. Lively carbonation, quite prickly, actually. Overall: I desired more maple, all things considered. Well made beer, but the coffee at this point is a bit too bold and the bitter roast distracts from the balance of the beer. With time, I think this could age into something wonderful, especially if the maple pops a bit more as the coffee ages out. As far as maple/coffee stouts go, there are better out there if you want maple. I find Funky Buddha for example, being quite a bit more impressive with Wide Awake It's Morning and Morning Wood (along with Bacon Maple Coffee Porter, as well). Delicious beer... Would buy it all the time if it was always available or more easy to obtain, but not exactly worth the hunt with all things considered.

47658,Wolvmar,2017-12-09,"   Pours dark black with a 2-3 finger light brown head that lasts and lasts. Good, if not exceptional, lacing. Aroma was good but maybe less than expected. chocolate, lots of coffee, slight maple, bourbon and oak tones. Pleasant but doesn’t slap you in the face. Taste and subtle complexity is where CBS really shines. Big coffee, dark chocolate, licorice and maple on the backend. It’s doesn’t have in your face hops and booze like KBS. It’s very easy to drink. As it warmed the maple flavor came through even more. I would get the bottle temp to 45-ish degrees before opening then appreciate the flavor changes as it warms into the 50s. Other than the coffee, all the flavors are subtly blended and exceptionally smooth. One of the best but maybe just a tiny notch below Bell’s Black Note. Mouthfeel is really good. Velvety fullness with moderate carbonation. The maple is not cloyingly sweet but leaves a coating in your mouth. Overall, this is a great stout, worthy of the hype. It won’t change your life but certainly will be a beer drinking highlight. I’m looking forward to a second bottle and/or a draft tasting to compare with initial impression. Also want to see how my stash ages over the next year or two. Feb 2018 Note: second bottle was as good or better than the first. I let it warm a bit this time and the flavors really shined through. More coffee, more chocolate, more black licorice. Maple sweetness is always there but still subtle and in harmony with the other bold flavors. Still not a ton of nose but that may be partially the fault of my nose and the hotel room tumbler.  ",4.5,4,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.51

Good retention and great lacing S -- More muted than expected. Maple, milk chocolate, coffee, oak, vanilla, toffee, bourbon. The oak and bourbon character is subdued T -- The sweetness of the maple offsets the intense chocolate, coffee, and bourbon flavors of KBS wonderfully. Turns a beer that I think tastes like an Irish coffee with chocolate syrup into a decadent, gentle sipper. The barrel character -- as others have pointed out -- is weaker than it could be. Perhaps a few more months in the barrels before bottling? F -- Wonderfully fluffy, velvety mouthfeel that dances across the palate. Medium- carb. Quite sweet, but not cloying O -- It's a great stout, worthy of the hype. Is it worthy of the price? Maybe a bottle a year..... 92/100  ",4.25,4.25,4.75,5,4.5,4.58

125646,howielchen8,2016-04-18,"   16oz tallboy can poured into a snifter glass. L - True to the name, Haze pours a very hazy, almost opaque orange, with a thin film of pearl-white head that dissipates and leaves some streaking on the glass and surface. The color and opacity resembles freshly squeezed orange juice, in a way. S - There's a distinct sweetness on the first whiff that reminds me of nectarines and peaches, followed by more subtle notes of papaya and a hint of orange. The sharper citrus notes that are typical of hop bombs are missing, and in its place is a slight touch of honey. As expected, there's a pretty strong earthy dankness backing up all of scents, making for an overall smell that's more warm and comforting than tropical and refreshing like most IPAs. Different, but still very nice. T - The tropical papaya notes come through pretty clearly on the first sip, which is followed by a slight maltiness. Not the most refreshing or juicy of IPAs, but definitely still very enjoyable. Finished with a strong dash of hop resin, which comes across slightly more bitter than crisp. It has all the right components of a great DIPA, but somehow, it's not making a huge impression on me. Admittedly, this might be because I've been drinking some fantastically fresh IPAs lately (Other Half Stacks on Stacks, Grimm Tesseract, Heady Topper, etc.). F - Mouthfeel is pretty consistent with all the other characteristics. Moderately fine carbonation brings a spritz that complements the hoppiness, and a slight viscosity of the liquid itself goes along with the smell and look. O - I can't exactly say I'm disappointed by Haze, since it's still a very good double IPA. Definitely not as impressive as the other Tree House IPA I've had so far though (Bright), and some of its contemporary DIPAs that I mentioned earlier. I would get this again, but there are other beers that I've had before that I'd be more keen on acquiring more of.  ",4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.1

125646,PaleAleHater,2016-04-13,"   This is quite possibly the most vile, putrid, and over-hyped beer I have ever consumed. It smells of a sun-baked, two week overdue litter box and tastes like a combination of mango, papaya, and guava juice mixed with alley cat urine. I suspect the carefully selected hop mixture has a neurotoxic effect on the brain that forces formerly astute beer drinkers to stand in line for hours awaiting their Great Depression era rations of this sludge. Chemical engineering and marketing genius. Looks like beer. Feel is tough to judge because it is forcefully ejected from my mouth before I have much time to ponder the oral sensation of this prized brew.

47658,LiquidAmber,2017-12-07,"   Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black, appearing opaque black in the glass with a fine, one finger, light brown head with great retention and thick lacing. Aroma of semi-sweet dark toasted malt, chocolate, latte coffee, bourbon, well balanced and inviting. Flavor follows, with mildly sweet dark toasted malt, chocolate, coffee, light maple and bourbon. Finishes with wonderfully balanced milky mocha and bourbon. Medium bodied with nice creaminess and excellent mouth feel. Well, this one has been on my want list for a long time, and I was almost prepared to be a little let down because of its hype and the long wait, but this really lives up to its reputation. It’s a little on the sweet side, which might be an issue for some stout fans, but tastes great to me and is not cloying as a syrup infused brew could be. As a matter of fact, the real story here is balance, a good thick malt body supports the coffee, maple, bourbon and chocolate flavors, but none dominates (maybe a little on the bourbon side, but I'll never quibble about that). This is definitely one of the best stouts I've ever had. My first taste was a 'wow' taste and that's always a good start. The only big problem with this one is the 750ml format; it's just too big unless you have a few people around to split this with. The beautiful balance is accompanied by well covered big ABV, making this dangerously inviting to keep sipping. But when life hands you too much of a good thing, it's best to drink up. This is definitely world class. Glad to have finally scored a bottle. Although our local market is full of excellent local IPAs and stouts, Founders has stood out as a welcome visitor. Since coffee stouts are bit of a dilemma for me because I drink in the evening (no ""breakfast"" stout for me) and respond well to caffeine, I expected this to be a one-and-done. Nope, I'll chase this next time it comes to town. I can see why this might be a bit on the sweet side for some palates, but for me, the overall balance of flavors with the great silky mouthfeel are hard to beat. Mmmm.  ",4.75,4.75,5,4.5,4.75,4.83

It is delicious and inviting. Smell is very interesting and good. Light sweet and sugary maple syrup note. There is a bit of lightly smoked bacon. There is also a slight bitter dark chocolate but it gets lost in the syrup. Taste is good. Has a good maple syrup sweetness running through it with nice roasted malt undertones. The syrup is definitely strong and overpowers the other notes. Feel is good. Heavy body with a slight thinness and syrupy feel. Carbonation is tingling with a bit of biting but goes away quickly.

47658,Namven,2017-12-06,"   Honestly, I was quite underwhelmed with this release by Founders. After highly anticipating it and managing to get a bottle of it, I was expecting something a bit better. While not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, there wasn't anything spectacular about it. Personally it tasted more like a regular Founders Breakfast Stout with stronger alcohol content. I tried it relatively chilled, as well as a bit warmer, just below room temperature, and the latter is the way I recommend. The maple flavor comes out much more when warmer, and overall makes the taste really flourish. At a colder temp, it tastes more boozey and most of the other flavors included into the brew become muted, nigh unnoticeable. A solid beer, worth trying if you are a fan of breakfast stouts, but you may be a little disappointed if you've never had it before and have been hyped up about it. Take it with a grain of salt.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

Beer poured a Quad IPA pale with a nice white head that has some nice hang time. Nose is citrusy and fresh. Taste is hop forward. Notes of citrus, peach, lemon, and a touch of peppery pine. Just a touch of alcohol heat felt in my belly after the first sips. There is enough hopping to keep the massive malt bill sweetness tamed. Feel is medium bodied and fantastically smooth yet fresh. Overall this is quite a nice brewing job by the folks at Victory. This is a Quad IPA all the way. Do not expect V-Twelve or any other quad you have had in the past. I am really curious as to the IBU's in this beer as it has to be in the 100-130 range to tame this monster! Cheers!  ",4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.28

173310,tsmith1nu,2015-11-20,"   The last time I had a beer from Victory I was highly disappointed. So much so it has been years since I was willing to give them a second chance. Hoppy quad has made me change my mind about them. Weak on the nose, I can barely smell the hops in it, and was apprehensive before taking my first sip. Everything changed after that first sip. Mild in body, medium in hoppy-ness, solid on the finish. The after taste makes you want to take another sip right away, in a good way. It has this effervescent feel in the mouth that was equal parts unexpected and enjoyable. I picked it up from my local bottle shop for $9.66 + tax and for that price I would recommended picking one up for yourself, maybe one for the aging cellar if you are into that sort of thing or gift it to an up and coming beer geek friend/family .  ",4.5,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4.1

173310,barczar,2015-11-16,"   Aroma is resiny, citrusy, and floral, with big pear and apple esters a and notes alcohol. Esters and hops are somewhat in balance, countering the sweet malt. Flavor is fairly sweet at the backbone, with complementing pear and light apple esters. Citrusy hops prevent it from being cloying, and the lightly bitter, spicy finish, rounds out the profile. A bit overly boozy.  ",3.75,4,4,3.75,4,3.96
173310,ChesserAbbey,2015-11-15,   Not a bad beer but nothing really to write home about. The hops are what saves this beer for me as I'm not a huge fan of Belgian styles. In spite of the high abv% it's not as boozy as you'd think.  ,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.71

173310,BEERchitect,2015-11-14,"   If you're going to call it a ""hoppy quad"", then the only way to make the hops really stand out is to lighten the malt profile. But not backing down on the alcohol content, the character of malt has to take a lighter profile. Let's see what else that Victory brewers have in store... Their hoppy quad actually sells an imperial IPA appearance- its bright golden globe is laced slightly with haze and capped with a stark-white froth. With the nose hovering above, a bright citrus, orchard and tropical medley rounds out with a friendly floral perfume. Once its malty-sweet taste reaches the tongue, it is greeted with supple confectioner's sugar, rich angel-food cake, and an overall candied succulence. And as those hops unfold on the palate, its true balance takes hold. With subsequent pink grapefruit, ripe orange, pineapple, melon, lemon and mango taking their turns teasing the tastebuds, a bitter, leafy, grassy and herbal taste transpires. While the stone fruits of apricot, fig and date contribute an earthy and fresh tobacco leaf fruity tar, its clean and resinous sappy pine taste and texture rounds out the bulk of taste. To finish, the medium-full beer has a honey-like heft, begging for its succulence and lavish maltiness to be savored and sipped. Not for those seeking a fast and thirst quenching session, its long and bitter linger is adorned with citrus peel, root, and torn tea leaf.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

Nose is coffee, chocolate, maple, and a hint of bourbon. Taste follows, with moderate sweetness and slight bitterness. Nice amount of bourbon flavor, but not overly strong. I am revising this review; the first one was excellent, but not outstanding. Five months later, this one was incredible, with strong maple right up front. Excellent mouthfeel, overall outstanding.  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4,4.5,4.55

125646,Mateo2699,2016-04-13,"   Tasting my fourth tree house IPA ever. Only other ones I've had are green, alter ego, Julius, and this one. So I'll go head and make a few comparisons. Pour is a beautiful murky, cloud orange. Seems to be a little more straw yellow than the other offerings I've had. Nice tight white bubbles head, great lacing on the glass. Smell seems to be the medium in the most hoppy, resinous TH I've had (Julius), and the fruitier tropical Green. Soon as you crack the can, you get whiffs of peach, orange, tangerines and papaya. Then again you still get that slight resinous smell in the back end, reminiscent of marijuana and sweet malt. Besides the tropical fruit and hop resin I'm getting some nice honey as well. Taste is an interesting blend of all the smells I got in the nose, tropical goodness like peaches, papaya and tangerines. But the most unique about Haze is its honey/sweet nectar quality. Definitely has a subtle sweet floral taste to it. Hop profile definitely isn't dominant. Sweet malt profile as well. Mouthfeel doesn't come as a surprise. Not as much as a fruit dole feel like Green, but a more organic orange juice feel. Overall, quite possibly my favorite TH I've had so far. Not as much of a fruity bomb as Green, not as much hop profile as Julius. Kind of the medium, like alter ego. But with a more honey/nectar flavor. Lovely beer.  ",5,5,4.75,5,4.75,4.85

157672,StonedTrippin,2015-05-12,"   i agree with the other reviewer that the dry crisp nature of this one, with the equally prominent ginger component is an improvement on the sourtooth, which for me felt a little busy. this is streamlined a bit, and is quite a bit more sour if i remember correctly. it has a vibrant pink hue to it, but smells less floral than i expected with the hibiscus. its always so intense, so cool move to dose it so moderately here, let me be an accompaniment, not a solo. the ginger is spicy and raw and fresh in the aroma, and it translates over to the flavor nicely, its not hot, but it is very up front. i am impressed with the sour profile of this as well, its more than just lacto acidity. its insanely sour, but has a lot of flavor too aside from just the acid. the wood seems light and almost neutral, not dank and heavy like it sometimes can. for as flavorful as this beer is, its also very delicate in its overall impression. soft carbonation, light body, and a really nice union of some interesting ingredients under a brightly sour yeast profile. not too many beers of this quality out there for purchase. it reminds me of a more sour jolly pumpkin beer i liked a lot. great use of ginger here, top notch from these guys as usual.  ",4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4.21

Tastes of semi-sweet maple syrup, somewhat boozy bourbon, dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, light wood, and light vanilla. The bourbon and chocolate really pop, and the maple sweetens as the beer begins to warm, and it becomes more enjoyable although its enjoyable the whole way through. Heavy silky body with medium carbonation. Overall, this is almost perfect. I don't get my hopes up for insanely hyped beers anymore after a few disappointments so I went into this not expecting to be wowed. But this beer definitely blew my mind. All of the flavors were perfectly balanced. Tried this on tap and I'll be trying it out of the bottle soon. Tried it out of bottle now and it’s even better.

47658,matcris,2017-12-05,"   LOOKS: Jet black with a finger+ of frothy tan head, that sticks around; nice lacing down the glass. AROMA: Fudge brownies, coffee, bourbon/alcohol, coconut, and just a slight hint of maple. Oddly I get a nice big hit of maple syrup from smelling into the bottle itself. TASTE: Very smooth overall, nothing really stands out, so, I thought the maple would be more prominent, same with the bourbon. It is blended well, but I don't know that I would have guessed it contained maple....maybe yes, but I'm kind of going back and forth between maple and coconut; and, no where near the bourbon characteristics of BCBS. Chocolate, mild coffee, a bit of coconut or maple, and mild bourbon/alcohol. FEEL: Carbonation is adequate...medium. Feel is medium full, not as thick or sticky as BCBS, OVERALL: Certainly a decent beer, but I'm a bit disappointed with the very mild maple, the actual flavor of the bourbon, and the viscosity. Glad I found a bottle to try, at any rate. Edit: I came across a second bottle, and this time I didn't chill it at all. I'm still not loving the viscosity, but I am getting more maple, and the bourbon is coming out a bit more; overall, it's a fine, smooth brew, so, a bump in the score from my previous 4.28.  ",4.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.49

S: Overall very pleasant aroma, with very even amounts of chocolate, coffee, and bourbon barrel. The maple comes through but seems to only dance around in the aroma rather than dominate it. T: Similar to the aroma, the flavor profile is very well rounded and incredibly smooth. There is very little heat given that it is 11.7% ABV but there are mellow bourbon notes pleasantly on the back end. There is a presence of oak and vanilla but it is not very forward in flavor. This is not a bad thing as this is a perfect fit in this beer. M: Silky smooth and spot on. O: Overall this is a world class stout. My impression is that it does everything just about perfectly but was never meant to be a ""huge"" stout. It's a perfect breakfast stout. It is unfortunate that it had been so hyped up over the years because it likely won't get the credit it deserves. I was able to have '16 and '17 KBS next to this on tap and CBS was on a different planet. $25 a bottle is steep in price but it is absolutely worth buying a bottle to try. Get it on tap if you can.  ",5,4.75,5,5,4.75,4.89

Taste hits the same notes as the aroma, this is tropical fruit bubblegum. The cantaloupe and green melon are the only distinguishable fruit flavors here but there is a distinctly tropical undercurrent. This finishes lightly sweet like a fruit, it's shocking how well hidden the 10% ABV is. Medium+ body with moderate carbonation. Overall this is the most drinkable TIPA I've ever had, I just can't put this one down. I had the June batch and really enjoyed it but the consensus among my beer loving friend group is that this batch is ""straight fire"".  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.65

I find most TIPAs too intense but this is so dialed in I would have a hard time guessing it wasn't 8%. Tons of fruity goodness, minimal alcohol heat or bitterness.

Mixed bag of flavours and smells: hops obviously rule throughout but there is an undertone of semi-sweet caramel/malty molasses in the brew also. Citrus based hop aroma, comes through into the taste nicely but doesn't take over completely. The alcohol level is noticeable but not to the beers detriment, it suited the strong flavours well.  ",3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.67

146914,Thisdrinkinglife,2014-12-06,"   Review: Bottle of St Mel’s Helles lager, 5.0%ABV The Helles lager is the most popular of the three beers in the St Mel’s Collection, their best seller. It’s always a bit difficult when an Irish brewer tries to replicate a German Style beer but I think St Mel’s definitely have got the right balance of authenticity and respect to traditions here. The aroma was not over bearing, and was of a good bready malty smell, decent on the nose. On pour the head did dissipate rather quickly, leaving a golden brown colour with some carbonation. The flavour was of sweet pale malts, wheaty, a little bread, with some sour notes and fizz. The aftertaste was strong and slightly bitter, but enjoyable. It was a quality beer to drink and a beer I can imagine would work well with a nice meal. If a punter is going to try a new experience and drink a craft beer then this beer would be a great introduction. A good local Irish lager.  ",,,,,,3

Smell of herbs as suggested with a citrusy hoppiness. Unfortunately the taste of listed herbs don't all really come through which would be desired for a specialty brew like this. Refreshing and interesting, but below expectations, close to their regular Fathom IPL I'd say.  ",,,,,,3.4

Smells fantastically hoppy and fruity, with lots of orange, and grapefruit, mango, and pineapple, with some dankness and pine and that sort of thing. This is probably the best Tree House beer that I've had. It balances pretty deftly the big juicy hop character that most Tree House beers have, with a nice level of dank marijuana type flavors, a hefy bitterness, but also a big juice blast. There's some grapefruit, orange, pineapple, and mango, and TONS of it. This is absolutely delicious. This has a nice crisp and creamy mouthfeel, with a great level of drinkability.

47658,darktronica,2017-12-05,"   December 2017 release, 750ml bottle. Enjoyable, but not mind-blowing, and perhaps with some flaws, even? The pour is gorgeous, with a nice finger of head and good retention and lacing. The nose is more subdued than I expected given the massive hype-train: a fair showing of bitter, dark-roasted coffee, high-percentage dark chocolate, and hints of syrup sweetness, but also some vegetal pepper. On my palate, the maple notes are inextricably tied to a dry astringency and roasted bell pepper suggestion, with the coffee playing second fiddle and chocolate fading as the beer warms. Moderately thin but with a very smooth mouthfeel that I enjoy. The finish is a bit off-putting to me, personally, especially after just having had some other big players in the BA coffee stout game. Certainly still a high-quality, enjoyable release, and my score should reflect that, but it did not come close to living up to expectations.  ",4.75,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.18

47658,TheGent,2017-12-04,"   To me this is maple KBS. A: It looks great in the glass with a very dark brown almost black color, and a creamy brown head that disappears as I drink the beer, bit leaves some very sticky lacing. S: It hits all the ingredients well. All the coffee and chocolate comes through. To me the coffee is dominant. Subtle bourbon barrel notes such as bourbon, vanilla and sweet coconut, followed by a sweet maple note. M: Thin like KBS, at least more so than I prefer for a beer of this style and ABV. F: Again, maple KBS. Big notes of coffee and chocolate. I found the bourbon barrel to be moderate. No overpowering wood or bourbon notes. Sweeter than KBS due to maple, which is pleasant. D: Very drinkable. Not mindblowing, and no lt up there with my favorite maple bourbon beers such as Michigan Maple Jesus and Maple Bourbon Biscotti Cake Break. Overall a beer that falls on the low end of outstanding for me. Happy to have tried it, glad I bought only one bottle for the price.  ",4.25,4.25,4,3.75,4,4.05
47658,anteatr23,2017-12-04,"   Pours a thick rich black with a three finger lingering head of tightly laced bubbles. Smells primarily of pungent dark chocolate, then roasty coffee and malts, sweet. Taste is sugary sweet chocolate syrup, with some hinted bitterness.. so much chocolate it's undeniable. Coffee is definitely taking a back seat here. Not getting much syrup other than perhaps a source of the sweetness. ABV is definitely disguised as well, and not getting much in the realm of bourbon up front, just in the aftertaste. Thick creamy mouthfeel, not overly carbonated. Definitely has a lot in common with its sister beer, KBS, but this is a dessert stout as much as anything is. I was excited to try this one after so long, and while it was certainly no disappointment, a little tuning down on the sweetness separates this from something totally remarkable. Still, a real enjoyable treat.  ",4.5,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.43

Rich coffee and chocolate dominate the nose, with hints of maple, vanilla, bourbon and oak behind. Big chocolate flavor up front, almost like a chocolatey milk stout, with coffee bitterness preventing the vanilla-maple sweetness from coming on too strong. Oak and some light alcohol burn on the backend. Coffee and chocolate bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. Oily, medium-bodied feel with modest carbonation.

Smells great, but way less maple and coffee than the 2014 vintage on draft. MOUTHFEEL: Soft and silky, low to medium carbonation, medium body TASTE: Follows the nose closely. Chocolate and coffee and maple sweetness blend in a very balanced way. Bourbon barrel lingers in this, but pretty subtle. Some boozy heat, but not much compared KBS. Overall the beer is very balanced with no specific character overwhlming everything else. I wish I got more bourbon barrel, as the beer is almost too mellow.

173310,Immortale25,2015-11-12,"   Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter. Label says Bottled On: 31AUG2015. A- Pours a light amber color (which is pretty pale for a quad, I must say) with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a large center patch of bubbly surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves a broken ring behind. S- Boozy aroma of leafy hops, some Belgian yeast character and a bit of sweet malt. T- Neat duality between the fruitiness of the hops and fruitiness of the yeast with some toasty malt backbone and a big boozy finish. Pretty drinkable for the ABV though with some notes of vanilla and stone fruit. Moderate bitterness. M- Sharp from the hops and booze with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side. O- First of all, this is not a quad. The only thing that makes it like a quad is the vanilla note. I would liken it more to a tripel, though I'm sure they called it a quad due to the ABV. That being said, this is a good experiment. You've got all the fruitiness and bitterness from the hops playing along with the yeast and alcohol quite well. Would buy again just to experiment with aging.  ",3.75,4,4.25,4,4,4.09
173310,Smakawhat,2015-11-11,"   Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Big crystal clear body, golden mix of copper and brass, with wild amounts of carbonation everywhere. Streams all along the sides, a good middle column in the centre, and lots of pinhead sized fine bubbles everywhere. Populating head, manages a simple white off the pour, two fingers easily tall, and a collar that always manages a creamy half finger puck when drinking. Some light sheets of lacing. Aroma is hop forward and juicy. Big notes of tropical juiced citrus and pineapple. Lots of classic Belgian character is completely burried under this at all. Smell more like a simple new American IPA than anything else. Palate manages to save itself with providing some true Belgian character, with an American hop forward angle. Juicy texture, with also a bit of heat but not too overboard and less boozy sweet. Fruit front hop notes in the mid palate with a dusting of sugar. Tropical pineapple and citrus notes with a mix of classic Belgian sucrose. Finishes thick and rich, with a bit of American hop bitter. Accents towards honey and sugars as the sweetness dials down with warmth and heat. A good boozy warmth, but controlled and not too overbearing. This is a total style blur in so many ways, and should just be called an Imperial Belgian IPA or something. A fun brew but if you go by the moniker that this is a quad you're going to be in for a surprise.  ",4.25,3.75,4,4,4,3.96

The nose is pretty one-dimensional and is dominated by the booze. Getting some subtle caramel and oak, but totally overpowered by the alcohol. The taste follows suite with the booze being king, but to a much lesser extent. Hints of caramel, vanilla, oak, cognac, and brown sugar manage to emerge from under the boozey dominance. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly syrupy with medium carbonation and a subtle warming finish. Overall, this was a boozey mess. Little to no balance and the subtleties of the brandy and cognac barrels were lost amongst the booze.  ",3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.42

157672,scottfrie,2015-03-09,"   10oz snifter at the taproom. A: Served a beautiful clear crimson with a faint white head. Wispy lace was left down the glass. S: Ginger and drying hibiscus on the nose with bright hints of lactic acid and flowers. Floral hibiscus is noticeable. Smells great. T: Definitely cosmic dust-like with drying and floral notes of hibiscus mixed with sour tooth tiger notes of ginger. I'd say definitely closer to cosmic in flavor. Not as epic drying though. Perfect amount of hibiscus. Ginger is present in the second half and is spicy and tingly. There is a mild stone fruit quality. Ginger continues into the finish alongside a nice tart lactic presence that creates a soft, subtle tartness. The aftertaste is spicy with lingering ginger and gritty from hibiscus tannins. Tingly spicy ginger lingers long after the swallow. M: Dry mouthfeel, medium body, mouthwatering feel, ample frothy but soft carb bubbles up and scrubs my palate. Some gritty tannins from the hibiscus linger. O: A perfect medley of flavors. Not crazy dry from hibiscus nor crazy spicy from ginger. Very balanced and exceptionally drinkable. One of the most refreshing beers I've had in recent memory. I immediately went back for a second glass. Makes you thirsty. I could drink this all day.  ",4.25,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.66

157672,alex24x7,2015-02-12,"   On tap at Mikkeller Bar in San Francisco. Served at 45 degrees Fahrenheit in a tulip glass. Surprisingly nice amount of head that kept its shape up until I began devouring this ale. I didn't catch much ginger or hibiscus, but I thoroughly enjoyed this beer nonetheless. It had just enough pucker. Wasn't sweet, which I hate. Not much bitterness. Carbonation was about medium. I'd drink this again, surely, but at the price and seeing that it didn't taste like ginger or hibiscus (little differentiation) I would be hesitant to fork over another $13 for 25cl at the bar.  ",5,4,4.5,4,4.25,4.31
125646,jvgoor3786,2016-04-10,"   Poured from a 750ml growler filled 3/19/16 into a 12 ounce tulip. The look is cloudy and opaque. It looks like pineapple juice but a little darker and more orange. Small, white head, which dissipated quickly, leaving moderate lacing. The smell is strong oranges - almost smells like orange juice - with a hoppiness coming through underneath. The mouthfeel is very smooth with medium carbonation. The taste is strong citrus - orange, and some grapefruit - but the hop presence is much stronger than I expected from the smell. In no way is any one flavor overpowering. This beer is incredibly balanced with no hint of alcohol. Overall, this beer is fantastic and very easy to drink. I completely understand the hype on the beer, and Tree House, if all their IPAs follow the quality of this one. Every taste gives me a little hint of different flavors. I'll definitely look for more from them, given the chance.  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

125646,Trevor11,2016-04-07,"   To me, all of Tree House's releases are world class in that they contain the signature creaminess. This element really puts them above all the rest. Haze is no different. It's a nice rounded navel orange haze bomb with the aroma of grapefruit. The taste is much more tropical than most of their other releases. As stated in the description papaya comes through along with guava, dragon fruit, and some pineapple in addition to the citrus of grapefruit and orange. The feel is incredibly smooth with that chewy cream. Stellar beer.  ",5,5,5,5,5,5

47658,Scott17Taylor,2017-12-03,"   Pours jet black with large fluffy mocha colored head that sustains for longer than I've ever seen out of a 11% BA stout. The aroma is dark roasted coffee, chocolate, maple. The bourbon notes are there, but are very muted and play in the background. Most of the bourbon aroma is vanilla oakiness. The flavor follows the nose coffee hits big up front before giving way to a big chocolatey sweetness. The sticky maple sweetness begins mid palate and continues through the finish. The barrel note is present, but this isn't a boozy BA beer. The bourbon isn't overpowering whatsoever, it's only throwing a bit of oakiness, some pipe tobacco and vanilla. The mouthfeel is the only thing I'm knocking this beer for, it's still amazing, but I would've preferred it to be chewier. Overall this is a crazy amazing beer, I just wish it was in 12 oz and affordable and I'd buy cases of it. It's an insane beer.  ",4.5,4.75,5,4.75,5,4.89

The smell has a nice and moderate bourbon aroma that blends with the maple syrup, coffee beans, and creamy chocolate. I imagine a nice cup of mocha espresso with, maple, and some caramel. The taste is fantastic. It's a nice combination of bourbon barrel, vanilla notes with dark chocolate with caramel. Hints of the maple and coffee are in the back. The feel is awesome. It's a heavy bodied beer with a very silky richness. The creaminess adds quite a bit to the beer's character. At $24 a bottle, I limited myself to 2, but it was well worth it.  ",5,4.75,4.5,5,4.75,4.69

Midnight Black pour with a bright caramel (white at top) 2 finger head that lingers way beyond expectation. S: Fresh cup of coffee at first that mellows to a caramel and maple decadent smell. Dark chocolate and stone fruit come through at the tail. T: Coffee bite at first that turns into a dark chocolate covered cherry that is absolutely delicious and leaves you craving more. Maple and Bourbon come in the after taste/secondary. F: A bit strong at first that somewhat mellows. It's a crisp acidic bite, but you definitely feel the alcohol. Would'v liked it to be more hidden, but it is still enjoyable. O: One of the best stouts I've had, I'm honored to have been able to try this one after a while.

47658,CHickman,2017-12-03,"   2017 bottle, pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger foamy brown colored head that faded slowly left really good spotty lacing. Nose is what I signed up for: bourbon, oaky notes, maple syrup, chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, dark chocolate, peat moss, earthy notes, pine cones, spruce, charred wood and roasted malts. Very complex with charred malts, rich chocolate, maple syrup and nice boozy bourbon making it lightly sweet and super dynamic. KBS with maple syrup, really impressive. Tastes like it smells with bourbon, maple syrup, oaky barrels, charred wood, chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, dark chocolate, peat moss, earthy notes, pine cones, marshmallow, campfire smoke and roasted malt. The chocolate dominates, with coffee and maple syrup adding nice accents to take the sweetness in stride and limit the bitterness. This could use some age to add more complexities, but it's still delicious at this early stage in the bottle. Glad CBS was released in NY this year, this is another white whale I can check off my list. 12/3/2017: Had on tap at The Lark in ENPT, NY and it was outstanding. More bourbon, more booze, amped up head and strong coffee and maple syrup added to the overall greatness and experience. The booze and bourbon/bourbon barrel influence on tap cut down the sweetness and kept it incredibly smooth. Raising the ""Overall"" score from 4.75 to 5 (which pushes the ""Rating"" score up from 4.65 to 4.7), but will hold off on adjusting the taste until I have this again aged from the bottle in 1 year.  ",4.25,4.75,4.5,5,5,4.7

Feel: Fairly balanced bitterness but still quite the citrus bite up front. Slightly creamy but not thick. Overall: It is a great DIPA but the market is flooded.

Aroma is very tropical, lots of mango, pineapple with some grapefruit, peach, and melon. Taste is much like the aroma with huge mango notes upfront, changing to pineapple, with melon in the finish. Good mouthfeel, medium-light body and moderate carbonation yield a pillowy mouthfeel.

173310,Sound_Explorer,2015-11-05,   This is more a imperial IPA brewed in the style of a quad. Smells really good and looks more an DIPA. Tasty and rather good for me I would have liked it more in the quad style than ipa but still fun and tasty overall.  ,4.5,4,3.75,4,4,3.93

173310,mactrail,2015-11-02,"   Lovely fruity and flowery aroma with that whiff of the barnyard. Clear golden amber-tinted brew with plenty of foam. Deeply fruity and full of mango and papaya flavors. Rather sweet, but it seems to fit with the strong sipping beer. The sprightly carbonation seems to help. Just acidic enough to go with the yeasty dry finish. I would have to agree with some who think this is more of a Tripel than a Quad, if it makes any difference. It's a full-flavored beer with lots of Belgian character. But the American styling makes it all the more interesting. From the 750 ml bottle purchased at Bottlecraft in San Diego for an exorbitant price. Still, it's good.  ",4,4.25,4,4,4,4.06

173310,jwhancher,2015-11-01,"   Bought a corked & caged bottle from the retail shop in Downingtown on 10/29/15. Didn't see a bottled on or drink by date on the bottle. Pored into my Bruery snifter for review. Pours gold with nice persistent rocky white head with a bit of haze. Carbonation looks nice & steady. Decidedly hoppy upfront with notes of lemon, pine, tropical fruit, and some hop resin. Some faint malt notes of biscuit & toast. Alcohols seem in check for 13% ABV. No off aromas noted. Smells like a double IPA. A wired orange Tang marmalade flavor hits upfront followed by a ménage of hop flavors and citrus punch. Malts seem light but somewhat caramelized. Combined with hop flavors, it first strikes me as odd and clashing. Belgian quad flavors seem nonexistent. Tastes medium full with an upfront dryness that finished sweet and a tad cloying perhaps from the hop resin. Fairly bitter upfront that gives way to hop flavors & resin. Alcohol seems well in check for 13%. Overall, this beer seems like a double or triple IPA, not a quad by any means. I wonder if Victory played around with their Dirt Wolf recipe to make a bigger badder beer. I don't get any of the Belgian or Trappist qualities. Perhaps they're there but I think they are masked by the hips if that is the case. For a hoppy IPA, this one satisfied as the alcohol is well in check and the hop aroma and flavor is very upfront, nice and enticing. For a quad, this one definitely missed the mark. Perhaps a rebranding of this beer is fitting in the near future.  ",3.75,3.5,2.75,3.5,2.75,3.07

Taste: loads of fruit sweetness as mango, pineapple, pear and orange is up front. A floral bitterness and the alcohol rounds it out. Mouthfeel: heavy in body. Light crispness to start, smooth at the finish. Overall: a slow sipping beer that is very sweet and had a nice hop bitterness.  ",4.25,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.84

Has a big chunky head head but it fell down to almost nothing S: big tart fruity smell like mango but acidic some big clove but cut in half by the hoppy floral nose T: Wow the alcohol is in your face and not too overwhelming with the banana and clove as I feared but a nice dose of hops but they are more floral and herbal than fruity M: medium to a little fuller O: This is a lot better than I was expecting but the alcohol is over the top wow is this boozy tastes absolutely nothing like a quad none of that deep fig raisin toffee taste its more light light clove with lots of floral and a touch of fruitiness.

173310,jacewg,2015-10-30,"   On tap at Smoke and Barrel - Washington, DC Belgian Quadrupel with Chinook, Mosaic, Cascade, and Citra hops Appearance: This is a gorgeous, but confusing beer. It's only slightly darker than Pilsner. A light orange with yellow hints. Good clarity and impressive head retention. Nothing approaching the color of a Belgian Quad or BSDA. Nose: Very interesting nose. Almost boozy Belgian-IPA esque. Definite Belgian yeast character. Lots of vanilla/woody character. Peaches, citrus, and hints of pine and tropical fruit. The sweetness gives everything a sort of candied aroma. Some booze, but not overwhelming for 13% Taste: Lots of perceived sweetness, but thankfully a fairly dry finish with only moderate lingering sugariness. Lots of fruit and yeast character. Lots of yeast-driven fruits: apple, pear, etc as well as hop driven flavors: peach. tropical, pine, resin. Again, intense vanilla that I struggle to totally place. No dark or toasted malt character whatsoever. Feel: Medium bodied given the ABV. Carbonation keeps it from ever being cloying, though it does lean a bit sweet. Overall: A beer with some very nice qualities that is extremely mislabeled as a quad.  ",4,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.85
173310,rolltide8425,2015-10-29,"   Closer to DIPA than a Quadrupel if you ask me. The nose is bursting with tropical fruit and piney hops. There is a Belgian character on the palate from the yeast but make no mistake, this beer is about the hops.  ",3.75,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,4.12

Spotty lacing at best but leaves a slick coating all around the glass. Aroma - Huge balanced notes of maple, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, coffee and oak. Taste - The maple seems to hit first then the other flavors chocolate, vanilla, and coffee. The bourbon and oak hit toward the end. All of the flavors are very well balanced. Feel - Smooth creamy and slick soft carbonation with just the right amount of heat from the bourbon. Overall - Probably one of the most balanced BBA stouts I have tried the flavors are great and it is very easy drinking.  ",4.25,4.5,5,4.75,4.75,4.76
47658,Scottsbeer,2017-12-02,"   2017 release with the all of the hype I needed to try this one. Poured too cold for the style with a semi gentle pour and this beer gave me a finger and a half of a mocha colored head. Subsided rather rapidly and left a huge amount of lacing clinging to every surface of the glass. So dark that no light penetrates. Smell is decadent chocolate, oak, vanilla, maple, bourbon, coffee and maybe some dark fruit. Taste WOW. The hype is not over rated! I don't care who owns the brewery this stuff is awesome! Starts with decadent chocolate and strong coffee. Vanilla and oak from the barrel kicks in then the subtle maple and Bourbon follow up, The finish is bitter chocolate sweetened by maple syrup with a slight warming with vanilla and bourbon notes. As it warms a little I am also getting breads, fig and barley. Just perfect. Feel is slightly chewy, lightly syrupy and the perfect amount of thick and medium carbonation. Overall; One of the best, If you can get it try it.  ",5,4.75,5,5,5,4.94

On the bright side, I can't stand Bourbon County and never could. Want to talk boozy, gimmicky mess? Talk Bourbon County. I got a perfect pour into a four ounce snifter. I've seen some youtube video where folks got explosive heads of foam, not me. Black as hell with a persistent quarter-finger head. Beautiful. Smells like an American imperial stout absolutely should. Easy on the nose, not a whiff of alcohol and not too much coffee. One of the few imperial stouts that are touted as being coffee and chocolate forward where it isn't coffee first and chocolate a distant second. Exquisite. Smells essentially like KBS which is a compliment. Mouth feel is slightly, and I mean ever so slightly, thin. This is still a satisfactorily thick imperial stout but I would not describe it as chewy. Tastes perfect and I mean literally perfect. I am not assaulted by coffee, bourbon, chocolate or maple syrup. Magnificently blended. Great, great beer. I picked up one bottle of 2011 from Half Time, enjoyed it but at this point in my beer advocacy I was not satisfactorily able to appreciate what was in front of me. This time around I think I'm vibing with this beer perfectly. Glad I have four of them, still giving two of them to friends for Christmas, sort of (selfishly) wishing I wasn't. BCBS SLAYER. I think the same thing when I think about any KBS from 2010 to present excluding 2014, but I think this is other-worldly. Does the 2011 release proud.  ",5,5,5,4.5,5,4.95

As one of two beers that passed through my area without my knowledge back in the day (the other was their Better Half), I had thought this would be a beer I never got to try. This 2017 release was a real surprise and despite the high sticker price, I grabbed two bombers. I let this beer sit out of the fridge for 20-30 minutes before popping the cap. Black-bodied beer produced a big, creamy dark foam head... Aromas of chocolate, bourbon, maple, vanilla, and coffee were all well-expressed, and supported by more of the same on the sip. Really impressed with how clearly the maple bourbon came though. The body was full and smooth, more sweet than dry or roasty, basically what I had anticipated.

Pours thick black which builds a good 1""+ thick mocha foam. Smell is surprising not all that interesting, some oak and bitter coffee. Taste on the other hand is fantastic. Super chocolatey and fudgey with a nice roasty maple finish. Well balanced and the maple is quite restrained and not overpowering. Overall, this is a high quality stout, far superior to KBS and many other maple stouts as well. The right balance of flavors, good to great body and it holds up nicely as the beer warms.

173310,ryan1788a5,2015-10-26,"   750ml bottle poured into a chalice. A: Amber-orange color with a very mild haze. Fine-bubbled white head settles into a thin slip. Pencil thin ring of lacing. S: Lots of pine resin and earthy hop aromas. Cedar. Grapefruit zest jumps out. Lemon peel. Leafy. Mashed mango. Underneath the hops there are whiffs of musty yeast. pepper, clove and ginger spice notes. A touch medicinal. Vanilla. Tropical esters complement the hops. Angel food cake and fleeting notes of bread pudding. T: Earthy up front with hop notes of bark, cedar, and pine resin. Leafy. Peppery hop spice. Mango and grapefruit rind. Chalky yeast. Spice notes of black pepper, ginger, and clove. Pear. Vinous white grapes. Alcohols go in the direction of hot but stop just short. Treacle and caramel from the malt. White bread crust. Trailing alcohols and spicy and mashed mango hop flavors. M: Medium-light body. Full, round, and whipped in texture. It fills the mouth with an airy and silky feel, but stays very light. Sharp scrubbing carbonation cuts through like a knife. Big warming alcohol. O: The balance of power perhaps favors the hops a little, but they play pretty nicely with the base Belgian beer. Not the most complex Belgian ale around either, mainly because the hops do hog a good deal of attention. Obviously it takes many liberties from a style standpoint, but that's the point. Taken for what it is, it's still pretty solid.  ",3.75,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.84

Very sweet, hoppy notes on this one. Lemon/lime zest, resinous pine, tropical citrus fruits, candy peach gummies, sour apple, strawberry, peppery spice, sweet honey and caramel malt. I was expecting something very syrupy and cloying but this was very smooth. Nice carbonation with lots of sweetness but it well balanced by the bitterness of the hops. There's more booze evident in the taste but its more warming than biting. Definitely doesn't drink like a 13%. You get some Belgian yeast banana notes, tropical citrus, dankness, peach, black pepper, honey sweetness, and caramel. I'd put it in the triple belgian IPA category.  ",4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.35

173310,DIM,2015-10-25,"   This was a clear, shining golden color and it poured with a thick, creamy head. This was bursting with tropical fruit aromas of pineapple and mango, plus lots of melon. The ""hoppy"" part of the name is no lie. I did find some fruity, Belgian yeast esters that I would call more tripel than quad. The candi sugar was prominent while the 13% abv was not. This was both incredibly hoppy and incredibly sweet. The hops were very much fruit forward, mostly melon and pineapple, with very little bitterness. There was a minty dankness to the hops as well. I found plenty of candi sugar and strong, fruity esters as well. Nothing in the flavor profile was quad-like. The body lush, chewy, and silky smooth. Overall this was an odd beer that was oddly misnamed in my opinion. I just didn't find any quad characteristics here. But on the other hand, I have had a dark tripel, so why not a light quad? I enjoyed this well enough, but 750ml was a LOT to get through. I would recommend this to a friend with one shoulder raised and my head cocked to one side in a sort of half shrug of ambivalence.  ",4.25,3.75,3.5,4.25,3.5,3.68

The aroma emphasizes the tropical fruit, melon, grapefruit characters of a Double IPA rather than the deep, bold sweet malt and spicy characters of a Quad. No booze - so that's worth noting. Light to medium body. The taste: can you say hoppy grapefruit and melon? I know they market this as a hoppy Quad and at least for the hoppy part - I give it high marks. But come on, I would have liked just a hint of raisins, licorice,Belgian yeast, or sweet malts that usually define a Quad with perhaps a big hoppy finish. I did not get it. Maybe my bottle was bad considering the high grades this is getting.  ",3,3.75,3.5,3,3.5,3.48

173310,Shroud0fdoom,2015-10-16,"   750 ml bottle into a Wine Glass. Ok, I am reviewing this based on a High Gravity Hoppy Brew and not a Belgian Quadruple. Victory is pretty much saying ""Style Guidelines Be Damned!"". Well enough jibber jabber, let's get it on! While I popped this baby's Cork, she made the most sexiest sound possible. It was a rich Pop! I had to put that in here because it was other worldly the sound this brew made. So now I pour this ""Quad"" into my Wine Glass, she Pours hideous for a ""Quad"". Yet, again I am judging this on a HG Pale Ale and not the Dark Malted Beverage we've grew to love. She pours a nice Copper Tone on the verge of being Bronze. Nice looking really. She was crowned with a huge soapy white head that lasted a few seconds. Looks Belgian enough! Aroma Therapy should tell me which direction we are going in! Wow, first waves of Citrus being Molested by some Tropical Stone Fruits. Picture Oranges and Lemons with the back up of Grapefruit being Raped by Honeydew Melons, Pineapple and Un-ripe Mangos. Some ripe Berries getting in on the action too! Yeah this brew is pretty enjoyable to smell. Let's taste this Biatch! First hits you with Malt sweetness that flows into heavy Citric tones of Oranges and Grapefruit. As it follows through notes of Lemon Zest gets to present itself in diligence. As this party continues Blueberries comes in for a visit yet gets broadsided by some Pineapples and Passionfruit. Then Honeydew Melon shows up wearing a toga bringing that refreshing Quality. This finishes Dry with some Booze but not offensive. Fruity esters in the aftertaste resembling Orange Fruit and subtle Tart Berries. The feel is Medium Built With that Soft Carbonation. Feels pretty on the Palate. Overall: I'm not rating this on a BSDA/Quad style because it's neither. Yet this is helluva Hoppy Brew. So I'm grading this on a IIPA or ""Quadrupel"" IPA, if you will. This outshines a few brews in that field...hence my score. This is enjoyable for a Hoppy Brew so don't let the Style Nay Sayers get the better of you. This a nicely crafted brew that showcases Four American Hops and Belgian Yeast. That's all I went into while rating this. This brew is Worthy.  ",4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.2
173310,ThickNStout,2015-10-16,"   Corked and caged 750mL bottle from Sherlock's (Marietta, GA). 8.99. Bottled 8/31/15. Served in a Barrel and Barley teku. Pours a hazy, pale amber with a tall, three finger pilar of white foam. Looks very pale for a quad. Retention amounts to some sparce surface splotches and a full halo thats only resulting lace is near the top of the glass where the head rested. Aromas of citrus zest, melon, caramel, papaya, a little hint of apple and a vague note of fruity Belgian yeast. The nose has more in common with an imperial pale ale than any other quad I've encountered but smells great nonetheless. Flavors are vibrant and full of both hopy and yeasty fruit notes. Mandarin oranges, golden raisins, melon, peach, apples, berries, papaya, caramel, faint chocolate, a little toffee and a noteworthy alcohol punch. The Belgian base elements seem to lean a little closer to a strong pale than quad but as in the nose the net result pleases me so I'm not complaining. Despite the booze heft this is surprisingly easy to drink considering the 13% abv. Full body, somewhere between creamy and resinous with softly fluffy carbonation. Peach, orange, caramel and raisins linger in the aftertaste. Victory's Hoppy Quad is a bit more of a hoppy Belgian strong ale than quad but was still quite tasty. I found it to be a worthwhile brew and interesting style mash up but will pass on buying more unless it makes it into four packs of smaller bottles.  ",3.75,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,4.2

173310,superspak,2015-10-10,"   750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 8/31/2015. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, peach, apricot, mango, melon, berry, pineapple, pear, pepper, pine, light honey, white bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops, fruity/spicy yeast, and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge lemon, peach, apricot, mango, melon, berry, pineapple, pear, pepper, pine, light honey, white bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of peppery yeast spiciness and piney bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, peach, apricot, pineapple, mango, melon, berry, pineapple, pepper, pine, light honey, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops, fruity/spicy yeast, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Good amount of dryness after the finish for the ABV. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and moderately crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible pale quadrupel style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops, fruity/spicy yeast, and moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.  ",4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.37

S: Moderate hop aromas consisting primarily of citrus, some faint resin, some biscuit lies faint in the background, traces of stone fruit. T: A big, layered citrus palate with contributions from more than one variety of hop in addition to the yeast. Medium stone fruit supported by a medium to medium high hop bitterness and a layer of malt. Traces of tropical fruit. Good balance between the slightly warming alcohol, the malt sweetness, the yeast flavors, the hop flavors and the hop bitterness. While there is a light sweetness though out, the finish is dry with a little juicy tartness. F: An absolutely delightful texture. Medium body and medium high carbonation.

The aromas I am getting are black coffee, espresso, milk chocolate, maple syrup, oak, and bourbon. As far as the taste, this brew is quite a treat. The flavors go very well together. Coffee and chocolate are most dominant, with a maple syrup finish that sticks to the palate. I hope you were lucky enough to get your hands on a bottle.... or ten.  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.71

Bourbon is there, but more maple syrup, molasses, slight coffee and rich, candy, chocolate notes. Taste is big, bold, and complex .Creamy, sweet, and flavorful. Sweet molasses, maple, caramel, bourbon, milk chocolate, lightly roasted coffee. Flavors really linger on the tongue. The maple syrup does a nice job of balancing out the 11% alcohol, giving it a nice balance of bite vs. sweetness. This is big and filling. Coffee notes intensify as the beer warms. Sweetness doesn't fade (a welcome trait for such a delicious beer), and finishes surprisingly bitter on the back end. Moderate-heavy body, big aftertaste, well carbonated. This beer is a meal. Drink it on an empty stomach (as I did) and it'll do some damage, or drink it after a meal and it'll fill you up. Definitely more of a sipper, but it is a very drinkable beer. As step up from the already legendary KBS, this one is a must try for any beer aficionado. Big and boozy, this is as dangerous as they come.  ",5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.71

47658,Lingenbrau,2017-12-02,"   Somehow, I just knew I was gonna be the asshole on this one... CBS pours a nice and deep dark brown, almost black. It has a slightly tanned white head with mild retention and even less lacing. Aromas of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oak, mildly roasted coffee, and toffee (syrup?) Fill the nose, but none are overly assertive. The flavor starts with a tingly coffee note. Chocolate, burnt toast, oak, and syrup follow in that order. The syrup seems to linger. The feel is smooth and rich. This may be the best part. It's roasted qualities lend a balanced feel, however the syrup sweetness stays, and stays with that same initial tingle. I'm ecstatic to have tried CBS, and quite frankly humbled to have the opportunity. I feel it is a very good beer, but not the end all be all. Would I try it again? Absolutely, for $8 a glass, but the $25 bottle price tag is a bit steep in my opinion. Cheers.  ",4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.29

47658,jltrovil,2017-12-02,"   S: Maple syrup, coffee, subtle chocolate. It smells wonderful. Interestingly there is no bourbon on the nose. T: Once warmed up a bit after taking out of the fridge the notes settle to a pervasive maple syrup dominance, chocolate, coffee bitterness, and bourbon burn. It is interesting to see how this beer changes amongst the temperature regime between refrigerator chilled and room temp. In my opinion, in the middle of the range the beer has the best maple forward flavor but also a much more forward coffee bitterness. It is interesting to see how the green pepper/chili pepper characteristics from the coffee come forward during the duration of the tasting as well as the dark fruits. It was a roller coaster while tasting this from a bomber and taking time to do so. Absolutely fantastic and unique. M: Creamy, but also lighter bodied for a stout. I would say it is borderline imperial porter/imperial stout in terms of mouthfeel, but it does not take away from the beer whatsoever. O: Definitely worth going out of my way to get. I suggest chilling this beer to equilibrium in a refrigerator, but do not let the initial sip skew your opinion. As this warms up it changes dramatically and becomes a phenomenal sipper.  ",5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.53

With warming new fruit flavors settle in. Tangerine. It's almost like a tropical fruit punch. The style throws me off: tropical fruit, malty, light body, quite hoppy. Is this a Quad?

Smell: I'd say banana and lemons, which is true, but it's a bit sickly, like cleaning products (or something you'd use cleaning products on). Taste: lemon candy, grass, banana, booze... all with a distinct post-digestion tinge. Not quite drain-pour-worthy, but not pleasant. Feel: on the thick side of medium, juicy, alcohol heat. In another beer, this mouthfeel would be great, but here, it just serves to amplify the bad aspects of the flavor. Overall: what a disappointment.

173310,Mongrel,2015-10-02,"   This exceeded my expectations on every account and basically stole the show during a recent visit to Victory. It's certainly not a Quad - more like a Belgian triple IPA. Juicy and sweet (but not cloying) and only mildly phenolic. The nose says big american IPA, while the flavor profile adds mild banana and spice to the big hop presence.  ",4,4,4.25,4,4,4.1

Good head that leaves an avalanche of lacing hanging off the lip of the glass. Smell is very floral with some citrus. Taste is some mix between a Belgian IPA and a big old American DIPA. Has a distinct orange juice aspect to it. I think the Belgiany-ness comes through mostly on the finish where you get a hit of sweetness, but not malt sweetness. Lastly, the alcohol is just not there on the taste at all. I had one, would have had a few more, but that didn't stop me from feeling it in an hour.

Surprisingly, this beer doesn't retain a lot of the American ""Belgian-style"" stereotypes in its taste. Flavor - medium bodied with good carbonation. Has a slow sipping creaminess. Overall - Very nice mix. For a traditional DIPA lover and non-Pilsner, wheat, Dubbel fan, this is a very nice blend...The ABV is well masked in this beer and the hop complexity is nice.

173310,ThisWangsChung,2015-09-29,"   This definitely doesn't look like a traditional quad at all: it's golden in color, with a tall white head. It does look good otherwise. The hop profile on the nose throws me for a loop - they're very citrusy and tropical instead of piny and bitter. I don't get much in the way of Belgian yeast, however. Its flavor doesn't throw me for a loop, it's exactly what I expected. It starts with some nice citrus flavors, while it finishes with hints of bread, black pepper, and gentle dark fruit. The depth is pretty nice, though not world-class. Being a 13% mammoth, a little bit of alcohol comes through, though nothing excessive or harsh. Same with the sweetness level: the finish is slightly sticky, with the hop level keeping things just dry enough. The way the shocking lightness and warming fullness somehow intertwine perfectly is just jaw-dropping. Although it's not very quad-like, it works ridiculously well as a massive Belgian IPA. 4.07/5: Best quad bastardization ever!  ",4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4.07

Offers a hot chocolate quality with lots of melting cream in it, topped off by a slightly spicy, still floral barrel. Very convenient on the nose, with a prominent coconut-coffee interplay. Drinks creamy soft with a sparkly hint to it, lighter mouthfeel, malty sweet and complex, due to the well integrated barrel and the adjuncts. Tastes of toffee, earthy coffee with a roasted, dry hint to it, topped off by rock sugar. The barrel adds a warming note to the flavors, enhancing the already established coconut sweetness, together with a flowery note and a spicy bite. A prominent creaminess softens the barrel and brings out rock sugar even more, complimented by a wooden coffee dryness. Finishes with alcohol soaked pralines, fudge, maintaining coffee and a hint of toasty coconut, long and tasty. Pretty tasty and well composed, apart from its thinner mouthfeel. The barrel itself acts as a link for the different adjuncts, smoothing out the different flavors very well.  ",4.5,4.75,4,3.5,4,4.16

47658,jvgoor3786,2017-12-02,"   Poured from a growler. The beer pours a deep black color with a dense, tan head that lingers, leaving thick lacing. The smell has tons of bourbon and strong coffee. There is a sweetness underneath. The taste follows with a strong coffee and bourbon presence. The sweetness and chocolate really come through strongly making this taste like a chocolate-covered espresso bean. There is a slightly bitter chocolate finish. The mouthfeel is perfectly smooth with a nice thickness. It coats the mouth nicely, although it may be a bit thinner than some of the other huge BBA stouts. However, that doesn't detract in the least. This beer is basically perfect. I'm excited to try it with a little age. If the coffee and bitterness fade slightly I think it will get even better.  ",5,5,5,5,5,5
47658,neenerzig,2017-12-02,"   Having this on-tap at Lizardville in Bedford. They are only doing 5 oz. sample pours in snifters. This beer is a very dark brown, almost black color with a tan head that quickly settles to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass with a big cluster swirl in the middle on the beer's surface and good lacing. Aromas of toasted, roasted caramel malt sweetness along with a strong whiskey oak presence, some maple, and that's pretty much it for the smell. The taste is pretty much the same, with roasted caramel malt presence and a very nice whiskey oak flavor and maple that adds a nice balance and some additional sweetness. This beer is not overly sweet in way at all though despite the total lack of a hop presence as far as my palate is concerned. Really very nice and good! Some similarities yet so many differences from the many bourbon barrel aged stouts I have had. This is one of a very few, and quite possibly the first, whiskey barrel aged stout I've ever had. Has a slightly crisp, so incredibly smooth, silky and delicate, yet just slightly prickly medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. The 10.6% ABV is certainly well masked, that's for damn sure! Has a very clean and smooth finish. An amazing beer all around! Eric  ",4.25,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.58

47658,ScaryEd,2017-12-01,"   Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The pour is pitch black, like straight motor oil, with a healthy finger of thick mocha head. The head literally does not go away, instead electing to settle into a blanket that envelops the top of the beer. The aroma brings a hefty wave of maple syrup, roasted coffee, vanilla, oak, and sweet milk chocolate. Pretty much exactly as advertised. The flavor is just stupid. Holy mother of all that is good in this world. Loads of milk chocolate notes flirt with the palate before a huge wave of coffee comes and seals the deal. But the night's not over. Coffee brought his friend maple syrup along and they're planning a menage a trois with my taste buds. My mouth just got laid. The feel is full-bodied with soft carbonation. Very creamy and smooth, yet a touch syrupy and sticky. But that's what happens when your mouth has a threesome. Overall, this is absolutely one of the best beers I've ever had. Call me a slave to hype but I fell in love after the very first sip of this nectar of the Gods. It brings everything to the table yet stays remarkably balanced and restrained. The maple syrup dances beautifully with the sweet chocolate, while the coffee keeps the sweetness in check like a strict chaperone at a High School dance. I'm so happy I got to try this.  ",5,4.75,5,5,5,4.94
47658,Kdouble,2017-12-01,   A bomber bottle shows 2017 release at 11.7 abv poured into a tulip glass. Look- A awesome dark black with two solid fingers of brown foamy head. Nice lacing down the glass. Smell- The coffee is slightly more dominant than the succulent sweet chocolate. Just a hint of alcohol which I’m guessing is from the bourbon barrels. A fantastic mix of aromas. Taste- The coffee is not as dominant as the smell indicated. The maple syrup really blends with coffee and then a fantastic hint of bitterness. Feel- Light carbonation with slightly sticky feel. A nice sweet aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. Overall- Definitely a world-class stout. A great taste with a big abv hidden in it. I’m going to age one of these and try to wait a year to try it.  ,4.75,5,5,4.75,4.75,4.91

S - Smells of raspberry pulp, dark chocolate, vanilla, dash of hops and some dark roasted malt. T - Starts off with some dark roasted malt quickly giving way to hints of juicy tart raspberries and dark chocolate sweetness. Some vanilla, day old coffee and light hop bitterness round things out. Finish is fruity with some dark roast, lingering on the palate long after the finish. M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Dark, fruity feel from start to finish. Booze is hidden well, only really showing itself toward the end of the glass. O - This one was spot on from the description.

99999,HattedClassic,2013-09-29,   On-tap at the Troegs Brewery. Appearance: The head and lacing are light tannish. Th head disappears quickly after pouring. The beer itself is an obscure and dark black with a shade of light red. Smell: The beer mainly smells like a chocolate raspberry cake. The chocolate and raspberry mix well with a bit of hops poking through but barely. Taste: The beer mainly tastes as it smells. The raspberry and dark chocolate tastes mix very well with the bits of roast malts and teeny bit of hops. Mouthfeel: Biting carbonation with a silky feel. Heavy bodied. Overall: An incredibly unique and delicious stout that I hope gets rebrewed and made into a seasonal for the winter or at least becomes more widely distributed.  ,4,3.75,4.25,4,4,4.04
255827,WildMaverick1200,2017-02-10,"   This poured like black, shiny syrup and very dense foam. Aromas of cacao, malt and honey please the nose. Flavor-wise, there's plenty of dark chocolate, sweetness but not too much like seems to happen in many chocolate stouts. The beer is surprisingly well balanced, has a medium-thick body, and does a great job of hiding it's 7.5% alcohol content. Very nice overall.  ",,,,,,4.06

The taste has more chocolate than the aroma. There is still a ton of roasted malt, but the chocolate really carries the beer.

62194,Spider889,2010-10-03,"   Got to try this at the Columbus Microbrew Fest last weekend. Sadly it was the only one of the special rotating taps of CBC's that I got to try. Nice to see something completely different from CBC though, and on cask no less! Pours a heavy black with a tall mocha colored head. Smelled of dark toasty malts and some mild coffee notes. The coffee could have been a little stronger on the nose for me, but this certainly did smell like an inviting porter. Plenty of charred toast, dark bitter chocolate, and coffee flavors in this beer. In a catch-22 I had had some Founder's Breakfast Stout the night before so I had both a good baseline for comparison and at that, a baseline that set the bar way too high for this beer to ever hope to reach. The coffee tasted thick and cold brewed, I would have enjoyed a more robust and fresh flavor to it. The beer was medium bodied for a porter, slightly chewy, and silky smooth due to the cask. This was pretty drinkable for me though, had I not had to leave for the OSU game I would have certainly come back for a second glass of this. Overall a great new beer from CBC. With a little tweaking (or turning this into a heavier stout version) I would gladly buy this again and again - you hear me CBC? Please make more! :-)  ",,,,,,3.92

S- I wouldnt say the coffee here is quite as delicious smelling as I would like it. Its getting close to that wet coffee grounds smell. All is not lost though. Some subtle chocolate notes come up from below and give the aroma a boost. T- Coffee isnt in your face. It isnt terribly fresh tasting either. The finish is the best part though. Thats where the chocolate and coffee mingle and give it a nice smooth, creamy finish.  ",,,,,,3.8

Mouthfeel is rich and full bodied. Taste is rather sweet with a lot of caramel at first sip. Malty and full of roasted grain, mellow, and smooth. There is even a little butter and a hint of caramel popcorn. Interestingly, the carbonation seems to be a fine-grained, slow-release affair that adds to the tremendous drinkability.

Pours a dark chocolate brown body, mocha head comes up to about one finger, good retention, thin film, nice lacing. Smell is intense roasty coffee, more coffee, milk chocolate, touch of white chocolate, and bourbon sweetness. The coconut isn't really there. But the coffee is great. Flavour is more intense roasty coffee up front, transitioning into a milk chocolate, white chocolate sweetness followed by bourbon and a dash of coconut. That's pretty nice. It's all there for you to taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, smooth with a nice coconut and white chocolate sweetness on the backend.

The creamy mouthfeel intensifies the experience, leaving just enough behind to keep you coming back for more. The 10% abv is completely hidden in the smooth deliciousness that is Old Mad Joy, well done Great Raft!  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.41
47658,CNoj012,2017-12-01,"   This beer pours a completely opaque jet black that is darker than Satan's soul with a 1.5 finger, sudsy, coffee with cream colored head. Retention is excellent and there are tons of spots and chunks of lacing left all over the glass. The smell is very rich and complex. Every time I take a whiff it seems as though a new flavor has come to the forefront. Sweet maple syrup, brown sugar, bitter black coffee and chocolate all take turns battling it out for their share of the spotlight, complimented by a touch of bourbon dancing in the background. Taste is the same. The flavors compliment each other so well. The sugary sweet maple syrup is kept in check by the bitter coffee and the richness of the chocolate adds incredible depth. Sweet, but in no way cloying. Again there is not a ton of bourbon character, but definitely enough to make you stand up and take notice, especially on the finish. Feel is outstanding. Full bodied for sure, but still very smooth and creamy. The finish is definitely sticky, but less so as the beer warms. The amount of heat from the alcohol is minimal for the size of this beer. Overall this beer is absolutely fantastic and lives up to it's cult status 100% in my book. I will say that I prefer my BA stouts to be well balanced and not too hot. So if someone is looking for a beer that tastes like ""licking the barrel"" they may be disappointed, but for me this one is perfectly balanced and ticks all of the boxes.  ",5,5,4.5,5,4.75,4.75

Tasted pretty good at first but half way through that maple syrup was just overwhelming and covered most every other character it may have had. 100 points, naaaa I don't think so. That's just the rarity talking. I felt I could have taken a KBS or even a Breakfast Stout and poured in half a shot of real maple syrup and come pretty close to it's flavor.

170102,Foxybrau,2015-05-16,"   A nice strong porter, if a bit hoppy for me. Bourbon and oak come through well on the nose and as it comes up to temperature the beer is sticky and bittersweet.

350657,TheHammer,2018-06-08,"   Appearance: The body has a thick opaque gold color which makes in so that unless you hold it up to the light in the exact right way, you will barely see robust carbonation. However, you know it is there because the finger of head in produces stick around for some time. In fact, I'd go so far to say that I can't recall the last time I found a beer with head that suck around that long. It also manages to produce some lace, as I would expect. Smell: Has a dry white wine smell to it that dominates the nose and is backed by floral and a touch of biscuit malt. It is very powerful, and doesn't require any warming to come out at all. Good stuff. Taste: Unsurprisingly it has a very strong fruity yeast presence that seems to favour wine and grape as it quickly overwhelms some mild biscuit and dry bread taste which then encounters a slight sweep of earthy hops to round out the experience. Mouthfeel: I'm not certain if it is the carbonation or the dry yeast and hop notes that are to blame for it, but after the lovely wine aspect, it takes on an almost club soda like quality I'm not a big fan of. Thankfully, it doesn't carry over into the aftertaste which is a mild earth and floral hop note that never gets out of control. As the carbonation seems to settle down, it takes on a nicer creamy quality as well the mitigates that odd club soda presence. Drinkability: That dry note really does hamper it quite a bit, but thankfully because the aftertaste doesn't really stick around very long, it seems to cleanse the palate quickly. It certainly comes across as very light bodied, which I'm not sure if the best thing for it. That said, it's remarkably easy on the system. Final Thoughts: When I started drinking this, Duvel immediately came to my mind. However it seems this offering trades the unconcealed booziness of the beer in favor of a much lighter experience, but at the cost of that dry note that seems out of place. I'm kind of left wondering if a bit more malt was present to raise the ABV slightly, how would it fair. That said, I'm not a brewer, I'm a drinker, and this is certainly one of the better Belgian experiences I've had come out of Ontario. I'm certainly intrigued as to what the Dubbel, Tripel and Quads will be like now.  ",,,,,,3.75
88605,Greywulfken,2018-09-23,"   2018 release with a 13% abv... Deep, dark brown body is basically opaque in the glass; center-pour into a goblet only produced a brief fizz of tan foam across the surface that quickly disappeared... On the nose presents a nice boozy dark fruit aroma, like prune and date and fig, soaked in bourbon with hints of vanilla... Similar flavors on the sip, soft fruits, a little bourbon, with a mild tannic note and some suggestions of oak barrels... Has an appropriate sweetness but doesn't approach anything cloying, and some impressions of chewy orange peels and treacle add a great edge to the flavor profile... Body is medium-weight, retaining its integrity as a quad despite the potential thinning effect of being barrel-aged... Smooth and graceful, a touch of stickiness, little to no bitterness - and a slight herbal spice toward the finish to put a little tickle on the tongue... Any trace of that 13% abv is buried in the basket of rich fruits and sugars... A very elegant quad...  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

125646,SovereignGood,2016-03-14,"   Canned 3/01. Pours a very turbid, hazy orange color with a nice finger head that leaves a ton of lacing on the glass. Smells like a fresh bowl of mashed citrus fruit with a strong herbaceous note mixed in. Tastes like a fresh fruit smoothie; citrus, orange rind, peach, nectarine - awesome. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy for an IPA but I think Green still takes the cake. A killer offering from TH.  ",5,5,5,4.75,4.75,4.93
179485,Pontzie,2017-01-12,"   On tap at the really good beer stop. A: awesome cola like dark brown to black. Pools into a viscous and luscious shape in small amounts. S: huge coconut with a lot of creamy vanilla and a solid chocolate aroma. Smells like a delicious sweet treat of chocolate and coconut. T: Amazingl, the coconut and all that sweet aroma are present in the taste but not overpowering for what a great stout should be. Extraordinary balance in the flavors. The finishing taste presents some notes of coffee which was not as noticeable in the aroma until after tasting this delicious stout. M: Hard to find anything to dislike, this goes down so easily that this is truly a dangerous drink... I might finish a keg alone tonight. O: A real favorite for me among stouts. I have had some really good stouts and this plays well with the best of them. It definitely is a bit sweeter than some of my other favorites but that is just a nice change and characteristic of a lot of things Funky Buddha produces. They really hit a home run with this one.  ",5,5,5,4.75,5,4.98

179485,gcamparone,2017-01-08,"   Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Funky Buddha snifter. Thanks Matt for this bottle. Pours a deep brown body with a one finger off-white head that reduces pretty quickly to leave a ring of foam. On par for a porter. Aromas are rich and potent - the ""almond joy"" aromas that everyone describes are definitely there but it's much deeper than that. Vanilla, whiskey, and roasty coffee are also present in addition to heavy coconut and chocolate. On the tongue.. chocolate covered coconut macaroons upfront, followed by an almost smokey note, roasted coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla-bourbon, caramel, finishes charred and again, a little smokey. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but this is a porter not a stout so that's OK with me. Low carbonation. Overall just as described. Worth a try.  ",4.25,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.52
179485,pmarlowe,2017-01-07,"   On tap at ChurchKey for 2014 DCBW. Snifter glass. A: Pours blackish-brown with a finger of beautiful dense and well-formed dark brown head. Big swaths of lacing and excellent retention. Hard to imagine a better looking porter. (4.75) S: Loads of toasted coconut up front, ample melted white chocolate and dark coffee, fair amount of roastiness. Definitely not for the faint of coconut. Smells appealing, but is really, really heavy on the coconut. (4.5) T: Dark roastiness blends nicely with toasted coconut, which is again very prominent. Light to medium dose of coffee and charred roastiness which imparts a slight bite. A touch of sweetness adds to the palate, which unfortunately becomes a bit cloying over the course of a glass. (4.25) M: Medium-light, fuzzy carbonation and medium body. Mouth coating and a bit sticky on the lips. (4.25) O: Very nice, but the huge flavors and sweetness really limit the drinkability. Would be good in 4oz as after dinner digestif along with a dessert that pairs well with coconut. (4)  ",4.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.29

The Barrel isn't overly present but smooths everything out and comes in at the end as a sweet good night kiss. Feel: If this was easier to drink it'd be well impossible.

A little fig, caramel, dryness, & Bourbon, plus vanilla & a touch of chocolate too.

F - Medium bodied and medium carbonation. It has a wet finish and is very smooth. O - For a BA baltic porter, it's legit. Not mind blowing and the flavors are a bit muddled at first but open up as the beer warms. But for a young brewery, it's pretty well done and very drinkable for 10% abv.  ",3.75,3.75,4,4,4,3.93

Finish is dark, bitter sweet chocolate, baking cocoa, and toasted coconut. Sticky sweet and full feel. A pinch of heat. Best coconut adjunct beer in the game.

No light shines through whatsoever, even when held closely to the light. S: Wow! Cheesy to say, and likely overused, but it smells like a mounds candy bar... chocolate and vanilla covered almonds with bourbon soaked coconut wafting from the glass. T: Tastes follows suit and delivers on the promise of the mounds aroma... milk chocolate, vanilla and coconut come in big waves with a little subtle coffee flavor balancing it all out. F: The chocolate, vanilla and coconut flavors keep developing as they sit on the palate, smooth and silky as can be. Overall, it's amazing. It's sweet... but as is the case with all decadent barrel aged beers, the truly world class use coffee in a subtle way that prevents the beer from becoming too sweet, and balances it out, instead of hitting you over the head with it.

Thick,creamy head,that is both brown,and light khaki during the pour,then turns a lighter shade of khaki upon settling.Dark black in color with no light showing through the glass.Very light carbonation. On the nose I get coconut,coffee,mocha,some toffee and chocolate.Also getting some vanilla and cocoa.The bourbon is there but it is very well hidden.The nose is pretty complex. The palate is mocha,chocolate,coffee up front,with a huge blast of bourbon in the middle.The bourbon is not overpowering or offensive.Tons of coconut,with some chocolate,and bourbon on the back end.I am also getting vanilla,cocoa,mocha, and toffee mixed in.There is a smokey aftertaste as well.The palate is insanely complex. The body is heavy and thick,and leaves a sticky chalky mouth feel.Nice warming alcohol finish. I waited in line for an hour an fifteen minutes to get my 3 bottle limit and it was well worth it.I typically hate all coconut and coconut flavors, and I'm not a huge fan of bourbon either.But this beer is fantastic.The coconut and bourbon is so well blended with all the other flavors,it actually makes the coconut and bourbon enjoyable.I can't wait to try another bottle of this in six months.  ",5,5,5,4.75,5,4.98

Snowed In had the most dominant coconut flavor of all the beers we had and some of that is lost in the barrel aging, however I think it improved greatly. Aromatic rich whiskey, coconut oil, coconut flakes, fudge, barrel, caramel. All comes together really well without being too sweet.

Not much on the nose, could be my environment getting in the way. Some maple syrup and cocoa. As it warms I'm getting more of a nose. Sweet bourbon. Light nail polish. Scores adjusted. Oh shit. This is incredible. Huge waves of bourbon, maple, and black licorice just invade the palate leaving syrup and booze behind. To say it's good is an understatement. The alcohol grows astringent but not for long as it turns to black jelly bean. Feel is huge, viscous, thick, syrupy...all the above.

47658,archiebunkerjr,2017-01-29,"   I visited Founders yesterday with my wife and my buddy to drink the wonderful rare beers that Founders had tapped for their annual Cellar Raid. Founders did not disappoint! The highlight of the day full of highlights was the tapping of CBS. Look - first glance of CBS was like many many other stouts that I have enjoyed in the past. Founders served their 8 ounce pour of CBS in a snifter. The beer had a slight head on it that quickly disappeared in a minute or two. Smell - you taste with your smell first and I knew I was in for a special treat with CBS. Coffee was the dominant note accented by the sweet maple and bourbon notes of the beer. No detection of hops whatsoever. Taste - I'm amazed that all the flavors in CBS seem to feed off one another. I hope this makes sense but the final product ends up even better than the sum of its parts. Just an exceptionally balanced imperial stout beer with the coffee, maple syrup, bourbon and chocolate. Feel - phenomenal aftertaste that stays with you. But it doesn't stay long because you want that next drink almost immediately. Not too heavy, not too light with a slight chew. And just carbonated enough to know it's there, but really, who cares? Overall - this is a beer worthy of making special plans to drink. You know a beer is special when it is introduced by parading the Canadian flag around the taproom while playing the Canadian national anthem. CBS is definitely worthy of being on everyone's beer bucket list.  ",5,5,5,5,5,5

47658,GuyFawkes,2016-12-30,"   Bottled November 2017; drank 2/13/18 @ the Yarchives. Black/brown appearance. A rough pour yielded a huge tan head; thick, frothy lace. Chocolate syrup, banana & faint smoke notes in the nose. Creamy, medium thick mouthfeel. Chocolate syrup, oak & mild honeydew melon flavors up front; a mild hop bite on the finish. Faint bourbon heat emerged as this warmed. Balanced & pleasant; not a mind-blower but a very nice barrel aged stout.  ",4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.34

173310,LiquidAmber,2015-09-21,"   Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a slightly hazy, medium golden amber with a nice two finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of bready malt, citrus hops with hints of tropical fruit, light stone fruit and light Belgian yeast. Flavor is sweet malt, orange family citrus and light stone fruit, especially peach, citrus hops with light pine. Medium bodied with light creaminess and peppery carbonation. This really does taste like a hybrid between a fruity Belgian quad and an imperial IPA. The IIPA hop profile kind of dominates the Belgian part, but since both are well done, this works fine. A lot going on here, with interesting interactions between the citrus and stone fruit flavors as well as the citrus from the Northwest style hops. Less piney than I'd expect from this hop bill, but still distinctive. Interesting and a worthy alternative to an imperial IPA. Not a classic quad, but does not pretend to be. Quite enjoyable. ABV well covered. Can't go wrong with Victory.  ",4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4.21

Liquify the above 7. Add powdered sugar for sweetness and thickening. 7. Mix with a touch of bourbon and milk-heavy cocoa. 8. Add marshmallows. Allow to dissolve. Yep...  ,4.75,5,5,4.75,5,4.96

47658,ONovoMexicano,2016-12-22,"   2014 on tap at Barcade in NYC. Beautiful looking beer. Looks rich, gooey and still. La Brea Tar Pits in a glass. Smell and flavor show a sugary sweetness, roast and black licorice. I don't detect any coffee at this point really, though vanilla and some dark dry fruit may be residuals of that. Body is thinner than BCBS, but plenty gooey and sticky and with the sugary quality there's a distinct texture. Drinks easily.  ",5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.3

Won't go so far as to say it's the best stout I've had but it is in the running and deserves all the accolades it gets. Very smooth thick feeling beer with bourbon hitting your nose before notes of chocolate come into play. The flavor has bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and just a hint of maple. Complex amazing stout, hope to get lucky enough again someday to have it again.  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.71

No bottling info Pours an almost clear golden body with a white head .Some retention lasted till the last sip, some lacing Not a lot going on in the smell department. A very faint malt, That ""Pyramid brewing"" malt-yeast thing that I smell in most of their brews Taste follows in that there really isn't a lot going. A little hop bitterness I enjoyed the feel but it was a little round for an APA. More like a winter warmer Overall; To some extent a lot of pyramid beers are alike.

Taste is an immediate spicy, bracing hoppiness with a very slight treacly almost bubblegummy note. Feel is a little sticky & heavy for me. This is a weird one. I picked it up thinking it was some American advertising chicanery meaning it was a Kölsch. Nope! It finally occurred to me that this is basically a Märzen fermented with an ale yeast. If that sounds like your thing then go for it.  ",3.75,3,3.25,2.75,3.25,3.17

88605,Brutaltruth,2017-11-03,"   From the 12.7 oz bottle in a snifter via the brewery in Athens from our visit. This fantastic Belgo style beast pours a murky dark brown mahogany with a light head of off white foam that settles to a thin ring with subtle lacing. The nose gives rise to a multitude of mellow bourbon, dates, oak, vanilla, brown sugar, and mild Belgian spice with a touch of cherries. Flavors---wow....rich bourbon that has all the flavor without the boilermaker taste rides on a wave of brown sugar that mingle with raisins, dates, and vanilla with a mellow oak note. Subtle cherry and cranberry display themselves with warmth as well as a light hint of Belgian spice and toffee. Excellent mouth feel; full body, lightly sticky, lightly coating, warm, boozy, meaty, beaty, big, bouncy, low carbonation, smooth, and sweet on the finish without being overly cloying. Flat out fantastic. Cheers  ",3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.32

88605,Lone_Freighter,2017-10-22,"   This was poured into a chalice. The appearance was a nice dark brown color with some lighter brown hues closer to the top sitting just under a quickly dissipating finger's worth of white foamy head. Barely any lace. The aroma presented a wonderful blend of sweet bourbon woodiness over some caramel malts, Belgian sugars, some allspice and clove, Belgian chocolate, dark chocolate, some dark fruits (plums more so), and ended with a little bit of clean earthiness. The flavor was a fantastic blend of spices to sweetness running through all of the prior mentioned aromas and then all coming together enthusiastically in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fine sipping quality about it. Nice enough grip from the spices along my tongue but not so much distracting, just noticeable enough to prevent any stickiness, slow mobility I like to say. Carbonation felt right on par. ABV felt appropriate. Finish was somewhat sticky, but nice enough sweetness from the Belgian sugars and chocolates. Overall, very nice bourbon barrel-ed quad - fantastic in it's entirety and would make an absolutely wonderful sipper for Winter.  ",4.25,4.75,4.75,4,4.5,4.6
88605,SomethingClever,2017-10-22,"   12.7 oz bottle poured into nonic pint. A: Almost no head whatsoever. Body is a rich dark brown leaning toward black with just the barest hints of light escaping. S: Vanilla, caramel, figs, dates, honey, and a little coconut. T: fairly sweet, lots of figs, honey, caramel, and vanilla. M: pretty thin almost watery no carbonation. O: the flavor of this beer is astounding, it’s got the best characteristics of the bourbon. Yet, it has some of the flavors of a great quad. This beer is worth checking out and a name to make you want to drink it.  ",3.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.38

88605,cjgiant,2017-09-01,"   Bottle: A darker brown, seems to have maybe a slight haze, but darkness hides clarity decently well. Very thin rim remains with some time, though it was medium thin for a little while. No lacing. Nose is is a pecan accented quad - date bread with nuts, perhaps. The bourbon is light but noticeable, along with a nutty maltiness. Flavor is a little sweeter than the nose indicates, but I am okay with it. It's not overpowering, and includes the accent of the bourbon, including vanilla. And these are accents... noticeable but not overpowering. I keep thinking pecan pie, and while this is much less sweet than the dessert, I can't shake the thought for some reason. I think there is a light bite that acts as the spice, a mild nuttiness, and the bourbon quells but sweetens the date notes. Truly enjoyable, another beer where Jackie O's adds barrel notes subtly but enjoyably.  ",4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.35
88605,Sabtos,2017-08-15,"   Dark brown lacquer with a minimal, thin tan ring. Smell is caramel, toast, fig, brown sugar, smoky maple and pumpkin pie--spices, crust and all. Taste is prune, caramel, chocolate, nuts, raisin and oats through a crisp, medium-full slick body with a sticky, semi-dry finish. Notes of mapled bourbon, toasted coconut, and warm peach cobbler emerge as it comes to temperature. Even though this one was a single element of the blend, I liked it better than Cellar Cuvée 11.  ",3.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,4.11

Look- pretty thick with a small mocha colored head that vanishes quickly Smell- bourbon coconut chocolate, smells like if you dipped an almond joy in a glass of bourbon and took a whiff, coconut more prevalent as it warms Taste- literal bourbon almond joy, follows the smell to a T. I can't get enough.Adjuncts definitely more prevalent after letting sit out of the fridge for 15-20 mins Feel- solid mouthfeel originally, becoming a little syrupy as it warmed, not too bad though Overall- definitely one of the favorite beers to date. Haven't rated much on here but over 600 check ins on untappd. Funky Buddha is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries out there, it's unfortunate they don't distribute to New York because I'd love to get last snow and their other porters/Brown ales  ",4.75,5,5,4.75,5,4.96

Snowed In has one of the most enticing, flavorful noses of any beer I've ever had - incredible T: In line with the nose, toasted coconut, rum, coffee, and milk chocolate flavors follow F: Moderate to thick mouthfeel and light carbonation O: Phenomenal imperial barrel aged porter. This beer encapsulates the sensation of drinking a decadent, thick caffe mocha with a shot of run whilst sitting underneath palm trees contemplating the transcendent, ethereal qualities of a rich, barrel aged porter. In short, Snowed In/Last Buffalo is a gorgeous and exceptional porter.

Like morning wood I didn't get as much barrel flavor as I hoped. The barrel did more for the mouth feel, smoothing this one out and making it more oily.

Nose is heavy bourbon and some charred wood with faint notes of sweet candied sugar. Flavor is also heavy on the bourbon and wood, actually in a nice way. The quad doesn't make a ton of appearance, malts are actually fairly rich, a hint of malty sweetness in back. Fuller body, fairly dry, a touch chalky in the feel.  ",2,3.5,3.5,3,3.75,3.41

Chocolate, caramel, tobacco, and make big impression with a slight nuttiness that is masked by the other action. The aftertaste is warming with the bourbon and chocolate staying strong. Mouthfeel - For a quad, I would have expected a little more thickness. That said, the beer meanders across the tongue. Overall - This is an elite bourbon barrel quad.  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.58

Aroma - Sweet citrus notes - orange, grapefruit. Taste - Sweet forefront with a zesty citrus notes - orange, grapefruit leading to a long dry bitter finish. Saw this in the local supermarket, supposedly hard to get so gave it a go. For some the clean filtered character will appeal but not really for me. Feels like an upped ABV version of Oakham Ales Citra, a great beer which made me love US hops but since moved on.

The barrel definitely takes a back seat here. Orange is subtle. Possibly the greatest head I've ever seen, like cool whip. Booze is mostly absent, just a strong and well balanced wheat wine.

171157,woodychandler,2018-07-16,"   I am now CANtinuing the seCANd phase of Happy New Against the Saugatuck Grain Beer Sunday (Week 699) & I am happy to be adding to The CANQuest (tm). From the CAN: ""Saison style Ale""; ""Brewer Owned""; ""Art & Design by RobbyDavis.com""; ""Strut Your Stuff!""; ""Vous estes le Coq de rien! Suffice it to say, some beers are meant to be the cocks of walks. This sessionable saison is just that, striding confidently along that most fateful walk. Brewed with a dash of spelt and late hop addition, this frothy delight is bright, rich, and juicy. So, finir son verre!"" Je parle un peu de la Francais, so the name means ""Cock of the Walk"", but then they go on to tell us that ""You are the Cock of nothing!"" The last bit means: ""Finish your glass!"" I had read that this one tended to be active so once I Crack!ed open the vent, I performed a gentle Glug into the awaiting glass. It initially formed some fizzy, foamy head on its own, but I was so engaged in my own actions that I failed to really take note. An in-glass swirl raised just under two fingers of fizzy, foamy, tawny head with very limited retention that quickly fell away to wisps. Color was a very pretty Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity, enticing The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Midas & Croesus to drop in for a taste. Nose had a light funkiness and a cracker-y maltiness. The CAN mentioned ""spelt"", which makes sense. Mouthfeel was medium, but very fizzy with loads of carbonation. The taste was kind of odd, very malty and as @metter98 said, more like a cross between a Kolsch & a Saison. There was a light funk and a light spiciness, but it was very dry and refreshing throughout. Warming, I began to taste apples, pears & white grapes. Finish was dry, almost champagne-like, especially given its carbonation.  ",4.25,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.81

Tastes more like a kolsch than a farmhouse, it has the underlying sweetness of an adjunct lager, its body is similarly thin and the hops, which you do taste at at the finish, are almost there as an afterthought. Bad offering from an otherwise solid brewery.  ",3.5,3.5,2,3,2.75,2.7
171157,tone77,2017-11-04,"   A thanks to the founding father of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Despite no agitation, this beer came oozing out, resulting in a golden color with a 2 inch head. Smell is of lemons, some funk. Taste is unusual, green apples, lemon zest, musty, some hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer.  ",3.75,3.5,2.75,3.5,3,3.12

171157,metter98,2017-10-02,"   A: The beer is very clear yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a half finger high white head that died down, leaving a large patch of bubbles on the surface, a narrow collar around the edge, and some lacing down the sides of the glass. S: Light to moderate aromas of green grapes and bready and crackery malts are present in the nose. T: The taste has flavors of bready and grainy (presumably from the spelt) malts along with notes of green grapes and faint hints of spices in the finish. M: It feels medium-bodied and somewhat crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. No dryness is perceptible. O: This beer seems to taste like a hybrid between a Kölsch and a saison. It's easy to drink. Serving type: can  ",3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.73

I've had a lot of really good beers, but to be completely honest this is the best I've ever had and its not even close. The combination of maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, and bourbon barrels is unreal. This is 10x better than KBS and that's saying a lot  ",5,5,5,5,5,5

You get a decent amount of chocolate with nice hints of the maple syrup. The roasted coffee flavors weren't as pronounced. There is definitely some underlying bourbon, oaky and vanilla flavors as well. Mouthfeel was a little thinner than I expected; low carbonation. Overall, this one definitely lived up to the hype for me! Cheers!  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.68

What a great birthday surprise it was when Bruce pulled this out of his Tesco shopping bag (no, this beer isn’t sold in Tesco). Pours black-brown with a creamy, tan head. Sweet, dark malt nose, some chocolate. Big sweet flavor, dark sugar, chocolate cake, moderate roast. Full bodied with fine to average carbonation. Restrained warmth on the finish, very sweet and chocolatey, light maple notes, some wood. Lasting dark chocolate, dark sugar and baking cocoa. A powerful beer with an incredibly cohesive character. That’s really the strength of this beer, the fact that all elements seamlessly come together. I would say this beer is worthy of the almost universal acclaim it receives. I really hope to try this again sometime. Excellent.  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.63

A bright fruitiness kicks off the aroma followed by a suggestion of spice and then a bready undertone. The flavor follows suit, characterized by a balance of juiciness, spice, and bready malt. The classic saison spiciness is more subdued in this beer, balanced but not overtaken by malt and hop flavors. The finish is dry with a lingering, medium bodied mouthfeel. This is a tasty saison, very balanced and particularly drinkable.  ",3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.63

179485,StonedTrippin,2016-03-14,"   an enormous thank you to my man jeremy for sharing this rare gem, talk about being stoked to crack a bottle! what a furiously delicious beverage. thick like motor oil, shiny like anthracite coal, with very little residual head after the initial pour, and frankly with a value probably far higher than any fossil fuel now that this thing is so famous. huge coconut nose, almost so intense as to be artificial, but it isnt, and its awesome. toasted and sweetened though, its pretty far removed from the milky pulpy flesh of the fresh coconut, but its desserty nature is welcomed at dessert time. i get less chocolate here than it sounds like others have, but i sure do get the bourbon. vanilla sweet on the nose, with the booze not shy either, and obviously the sweetness that would have to be in a beer like this. incredible depth of flavor, much more than in the nose, with the coconut still way out in front, but this time more coffee, bitter and even a little acidic to help cut the density. the booze helps there too, and the chocolate has a bitter note as well, so everybody is trying at least! the beer is bigger than the barrel treatment too, which i was worried from the smell that it might not be, but it is, and i am glad. the bourbon is an accent, and the vanilla it brings out is awesome. it really does taste like a candy bar, but i still taste the grain through the sweetness. in some ways i like the base beer better, i think it holds up better with temperature, and i think its not so shockingly sugary, but the barrel adds more than one layer, and has made this a pretty coveted treasure for the palate. as much coconut as can exist in a beer. if you drink a bomber of this by yourself, you are missing the point. to be shared and sipped and savored, even when it isnt snowing out. just short of memorizing, but really really tasty and special  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.46

82852,qchic,2015-10-14,"   Fascinating beer. Certainly in the realm of possibility for Dogfish Head and no one else. A porter with basil and (live!) lobsters. I'm not even a fan of lobster in food form (too much money and effort), but I'll try this gimmick. Def some salinity going on (maybe they should try a seafood gose?), and a sweet, fishy finish. Had the chance to drink one and it was a hoot.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

82852,breadwinner,2015-09-19,"   Kinda feels wrong to harshly review a beer like this, as it's obviously not about winning competitions or even pleasing all palates -- in an exercise in creativity. Funny thing is, for the first 4/5 of the brew, it tastes like a well done porter, perhaps a touch of the smoky/salty brine sneaking through, but mostly just some nice, mildly creamy roasted malt taking charge. But then there's the finish... Oh my, the finish. You swallow, breathe through your nose, and suddenly a wild blast of fishy/briny sealife swirls through your sinuses. Insane. And, sadly, not super pleasant. It's not terrible either. It's not undrinkable. But it's also not something I'd readily order. Fun idea, but I just can't abide.  ",4.5,3.75,3,3.75,3.25,3.4
82852,Crackblind,2015-09-18,"   Porter is my favorite style so take that into account as you read this review. Not a flavor bomb like a lot of Dogfish brews. But more than just a rather nice porter-wise. What makes this extra special is the nose - the lobster adds a briny aspect that enhances the quality of the brew. In the middle of NYC, I feel like I'm having a relaxing beachside drink. Well balanced and really well made without relying too heavily on the lobster aspect. Highly recommended!  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.73

60395,emerge077,2010-07-24,"   On tap @ Corner Pub in Reedsburg, served in a tapered pilsner glass. Review from notes. Thin cap of tan foam, with a sticky ring of lacing at it's edges. Reddish amber body, with slow trails of carbonation visible. Nutty, woody aroma, with clean malt notes showing through. It retains its Scotch Ale base without letting the bourbon dominate. Maple, light oak, peat smoke, vaguely grassy/herbal, dry bitterness and a nutty/woody note in the end. Warming hint of alcohol also in the aftertaste. Sweetness, not a clear bourbon taste, but more oak, and mild old char. It's dry with mellow carbonation that foams up a bit with each sip. Nice to try, it's fairly mellow as far as barrel aged beers go (oak chips maybe?). One was enough, probably wouldn't drink more.  ",4,4,4,4,3.5,3.9

125646,11-52_4hops,2016-02-20,"   Another superior Tree House offering. A little less fruity and a little more hoppy at the end than Julius or Alter Ego. Has that cloudy honey-orange color that announces that unfiltered goodness is on the way. Fantastic nose - mango, citrus, touch of pine. Taste says tangerine and pine to me with some softer fruits. Strong hops bitterness follows. Mouth feel - nice carbonation, then soft flow over the tongue, finishes with a lingering bitterness. Fruit flavors emerge more as beer warms a bit. Nice, appropriate carbonation. Bottom line - another world class beer. For me, among the citrus-style DIPAs and IPAs, Tree House is the absolute king of the mountain. Now if they could only move closer to Virginia....  ",4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.71

Lots of pineapple with coconut and lots of dark fruit too. Currants, sultanas and cherry skins. Yeah, oak sweetness, cherry and sorbet. Pleasant, boozey overtones. Taste is more vinous. Notes of red wine, with coffee roast, then gets coconut on mid palate, sweetness on the back with big booze notes to finish. Blended well with flavours and not too hot, just rich, and maybe slightly oxidised. Dark fruits with raisins, prune and a touch of pepper. Big beer as expected, well reined in with a lovely touch of oak to add sweetness and an extra dimension. Bit sharp towards the back, but otherwise decent body for the style. Flat, which is good.

It's quite fluid and liquid in the glass, but with a sense that it's big. Only minor head on it: it settles out very quickly. Lots of phenolics and esters coming through on the nose. I got banana, weizeny spices and serious booze which gives of raisins, rum-soaked dates, and banana leaf. There's a slight sulphur character as well which isn't all that welcome, but otherwise it's pretty impressive. Taste is thin and hot, with a withering ripeness and strength to the booze. Lots of dark fruit characters coming through but always pitted against that boozy sharpness which pierces and eviscerates it. Some stewed raspberry on the back along with a darkness that's almost inseparable from the booze. Finish is long, boozy and extremely sharp. It's intense stuff. Feel is sharp, hot and boozy. It almost hurts. There is impressive weight and heft of alcohol to this, and it plays with it well enough. The sharpness precludes it from being anything else but a sipper, but when you do sip and savour this it has stacks to show off.  ",,,,,,3.92

68518,TMoney2591,2011-04-30,"   Served in a shaker pint glass at the brewpub. Entertaining time watching this beer get poured... Anyway, it pours a solid black-brown topped by a finger-and-a-half of dark-leaning sandstone foam. Lovely. The nose comprises lots o' coffee, light roasted malts, light toasted oats, and light chocolate. The taste is pretty much more of the same: It's all kinda like the ancillary flavors (the roast, the oats, and the chocolate) blend together to collectively compliment the coffee at different times. Trust me on this one, it all works pretty well. The body is a seemingly floating medium, with a rather light carbonation and a ridiculously smooth feel. Overall, a very tasty coffee oatmeal stout that really embraces the cask-conditioning very well. Possibly the best thing I've yet had from this brewpub.  ",4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.08

69172,themunjoy,2011-10-09,   0% Had on draft at the new Portland location. The bartender seemed knowledgable of the beer and stated that this was a single batch offering. A: Unfiltered hazy Orange color similar to wet hay. Had loads of lacing from top to bottom. S: Citrus bomb on the nose. Strong hops and a little sweetness. Slight malt but almost unnoticable. T: As indicated in the nose... Lots of citrus and grapefruit with a dry finish. M: Medium body with the carbonation providing alot of small prickly bubbles which detracts a little from the experience in my opinion. O: A very tasty IPA the I would defiantly try again. As stated in previous reviews it is very reminiscent of the Frys Leap with a little additional fresh hop flavor.  ,3.5,4,4,4,4,3.97
69172,bishopdc0,2011-10-03,   Served in a tulip shared with my wife golden amber with a nice head to start. The aroma is wonderful fruity citrus smooth with hints of malt. The taste matches the aroma starts fruity with citrus then carbonation comes in and dissipates to becomes dry with a hint of malt and slight bitter.

47658,TheSixthRing,2016-03-02,"   Had [email protected] Capitol Beer and Taproom in Sacramento, CA. Keg dated 12/2014. Appearance - Served up in an 8oz tulip with a thin layer of cocoa-colored head. The brew itself is black with cola brown edging. Lacing is mostly spotty with a few broken webs. Smell - Chocolate and maple syrup. Lesser coffee roast. Underlying bourbon aroma. Taste - Follows the nose. Chocolate and syrupy sweetness, adding up to a bit of a Hershey's chocolate syrup character. Lesser coffee roast comes through soon after, along with moderate molasses and maple flavors. Bourbon notes creep in near the end, adding notes of vanilla and oak. The aftertaste rings with a mild sweetness. Mouthfeel - Full in body with low to moderate carbonation. Thick, sticky texture with a warm, drying finish. Overall - This one definitely lives up to the hype. The thickness is a huge plus; many BBA stouts suffer from thinning out too much during the aging process, but this one holds true to a genuine impy body. Definitely one my favorite BBA brews I've had, and I look forward to trying it again when the opportunity arises.  ",4.5,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.47

88605,Dope,2013-02-20,"   Bottle 170/341 out of the '12 batch. A: Pours a very dark red with some brown in there. Big fluffy and effervescent light brown head. Minor spots of lacing but not much. Quite decent head retention, however. S: Decent bourbon but nothing overpowering. A nice caramel and dark fruit medley, mainly with grape, raisin and fig. Touch of brown sugar. Nice. T: Again, decent bourbon up front but it's not huge. Really nice sweet caramel and toffee notes with vanilla I'd say. Mixes in with the sweet dark fruits quite nicely. Again, mainly raisin and fig but definitely some grape and maybe even cherry? Just a hint. Vanilla, brown sugar and caramel make everything very sweet well into the middle. Sweetness fades just a bit in the finish, giving it more of a dried fruit flavor with some oak and some earthy belgian yeast character. A bit of drying oak and yeast linger between sips with hints of pure bourbon. No noticeable booze at all, very smooth. M: Relatively low carbonation, nice medium/heavy body. Smooth. O: This is really an awesome quad. The barrel aging isn't overpowering like some Jackie-O's beers (or barrel-aged beers in general if I'm honest), it just adds some mild but noticeable character to the beer. Mainly contributes a very nice coating caramel and vanilla sweetness to everything and gives another aspect of flavor to enjoy.  ",4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.3

88605,ColdPoncho,2013-02-07,"   258/341, 2012 A - Pours a deep brown/amber with a decent tan head. It's a bit darker and a bit less cloudy than I expect from this style, but still nice. S - Nice big chocolately dark fruits, vanilla, bourbon, warming alcohol. Holy balls this smells incredible. T - What's nice about this is that all of the elements in the nose are in play on the tongue, but in a different balance. This is really heavy on the dark fruits (plums, cherries especially), but the rest of these things come out to varying degrees. It's pretty sweet M - big and smooth, nice. O - kinda boozy, pretty sure this one is over the advertised 9.4...not sure if it would exceed Ohio's limits. But it's a good beer. By far, the best part is the nose, but it's good all-around.  ",4,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.41
280606,rudzud,2018-09-13,"   Received as an extra in a trade. Canned 8/23/18. A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice hazy milkshake pale straw hue with a thin one finger head that fades slowly to leave sudsy wisps. S - Aromas of dank earthy hops, citrus peel, orange jam. Light sweetness, some green grassy hops. Flashes of vegative onions though thanks to the Mosaic. T - Taste is similar to the nose, quite dank, loads of sweeter citrus peel. Like an orange marmalade. Flashes of strawberry too, maybe some light dank overripe pineapple. Tons of oats as well. Finish is slightly strawberry sweet. Flashes of onion vegative notes but thankfully the sweet jammy citrus drowns it out. M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, creamy, the oats definitely are noticeable. O - Overall this was a solid New England IPA, or milkshake IPA, whatever you want to call it. The mosaic clashes a little bit with the citra (with the vegetative onion notes), however, there are enough positive qualities to offset that. Very solid hoppy beer.

280606,DaverCS,2018-03-07,"   Pours a stupidly gorgeous golden-orange color with a great looking fluffy one plus finger head. Great lacing. Aroma is a bouquet of tropical fruits mixed with just a kiss of dankness and pine. Lots of peach and melon with fresh orange Zest sprinkled in. Taste is soft and creamy with a kick of hip bite at the end of the sip. Definitely tropical and with lots of citrus. More of an east coast beer with some remnants of the classic west coast. Overall, wren House is killing the IPA game in AZ. In my opinion this is there best yet. Perhaps the beer is a bit undercarbonated. I see this pairing well with almost anything, including more delicate items like fish. It gets a 94.5/100.  ",5,4.75,4.75,4.25,4.75,4.72

101228,Kenobi00,2014-09-16,"   Pour is two fingers of fine, white head settling quickly into one finger, with not much lacing. Dark golden colour and slightly cloudy. Initially, aroma is very promising. Strong pine, slightly citrus full and pungent. Initial taste is softer than expected. The pungent hoppy aroma doesn't translate to the taste or mouthfeel, and it's all quite smooth and subtle. Not as BIG a flavour as I would have expected. Overall, a very drinkable beer, and hard to believe it's ABV as it's so easy to drink, although not as BIG a flavour as I expected from the nose.  ",,,,,,4

The aroma is extremelly pleasant. Sweet and fruity thanks to the citra hops (on of the best aromas out there). The taste is completely different, especially after such a smell. It's bitter, hoppy, bitter and hoppy. A very strong taste with a bit too much bitterness for me. The aftertaste is also very bitter and I can still feel it.

Almost looks like a non-alcoholic apple cider. Poured a half-finger of white head that quickly fell into almost nothing. Sparse lacing. Smell: Peach and apricot off the bat. Definitely get some tangerine, guava, and mango too. Noticeable pine too; not as much as Green but more than Julius. Probably the best balance of fruit and pine characters of the TH beers I've had. Dankness really cuts through as it warms. Taste: Just as balanced as the nose. Pine and citrus working in almost perfect tandem. Extraordinarily bitter aftertaste. Not unpleasant, but noteworthy, in my opinion. The fruit really comes to the forefront as it sits out and warms up a bit. Feel: Fairly high carbonation that dances and explodes in your mouth. Medium to thick mouthfeel that foams and froths, coating the mouth. The finish is clean and a little alcoholic. Overall: Another top-tier beer from Tree House, surprise surprise. It seems that these guys and gals can do no wrong. Not my favorite offering thusfar, but honestly it really becomes a splitting of hairs when you're dealing with beer of this caliber. By no means would I decline the opportunity to purchase this in future visits.  ",4.5,5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.6

171157,BEERchitect,2016-09-19,"   A slight tilt of spice over fruit, of earth over cleanliness, of dryness over sweet; it's the aura of white wine that nudges Against the Grain's farmhouse ale into the proper fields of saison. Coq de la Marche pours with a soft golden glow, lightly hazed and crowned with an arid creamy froth. Bright with white grape, citrus, pear and melon, the beer soon counters with a tingle of peppery spice and vinous white wine. Malty-sweet with pilsneresque charm, the taste is bready, confection-like and with a kiss of honey. Swaying from the floral upstart of honeysuckle, the ale soon relies on the balance of spice over fruit to sell the show. Drying apple, orange, lemon and pear begin to trail off just as the winey spice shares a tangy acidity that brights white pepper, clove, coriander and vanilla to the foreground. Moderately biter, a taste of grapefruit and grassiness rounds out the middle palate ahead of a semi-dry finish. Medium-bodied for saison, the beer's creaminess overshadows the traditional racy carbonation and the beer's softness takes command over earthy dryness. Sharp, spicy and grassy, the beer trends more saison-like than of Belgian-style pale ale with the aid of wine acidity and light oak nuttiness.  ",3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75

The aroma was of light citrus and an earthiness that I can only assume to be the yeast, but a very pleasant aroma. The taste was citrus with some slight peppery notes particularly on the back end. It had a wonderful mouthfeel and the level of carbonation was very lively and pleasant. Very drinkable.  ",3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.69

Pours slightly hazy golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, melon, peppercorn, light banana, wheat, spelt, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, citrus/earthy hops, and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, melon, peppercorn, light banana, wheat, spelt, biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate yeast spiciness and herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, melon, peppercorn, wheat, spelt, biscuit, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, citrus/earthy hops, and bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitter/spiciness; lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol as expected of 5.8%. Overall this is a very nice saison. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, citrus/earthy hops, and bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink. A very enjoyable offering.  ",4,4,4,4,3.5,3.9

Taste is less briny and the porter & chocolate come out more, dark chocolate, some roasted malts, earthy, finish is briny with a very slight hint of seafood/lobster. Pretty full body for only 5.6% ABV. Over all a nicely done porter with a nice salty/briny quality. Very happy I was able to try, would buy it again given the chance.  ",4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.12

82852,iTunesUpdates,2015-08-29,   Interesting take on a porter. Had in a flight. Did not get any lobster at all on the nose. Looked like a typical stout but was a porter. Smelled of coco and roasted dark fruit. Taste is full bodied for a porter and a great beer at only 5%. The lobster kicked in in the finish and lingered with a buttery note. For what it is it's perfect. Too much and it would overpower but they got the flavor they were going for. Would have gone good with a nice seafood dish or white coco dessert.  ,4.75,3.75,3.75,4.5,4,3.94

The smell was a mixture of brine and vomit, while the taste matched the smell though to a less potent extent. Overall the lobster-taste vastly overbalanced the standard stout-ness I was expecting. This one is more interesting in theory than in practice…I'd probably try again on account of how idiosyncratic it is but this is the first DFH experiment that just didn't do it for me.  ",4,2.5,2.75,4,2.75,2.89

82852,ChainGangGuy,2015-08-22,"   10 ounce goblet - $9.00 at World of Beer in Kennesaw, Georgia. Appearance: Served up a very dark brown, near black body with an inch of dark khaki foam. Smell: Roasted malts, coarse baker's chocolate and briny lobster drippings. A touch of underlying dark fruitiness, a hint of spicy basil. Taste: Roasty, scantly ashen malts backed by a bitter chocolate quality and relatively light sweetness. Touch of prune. A salty, savory, fishy quality is certainly detectable from the precious lobsters who gave their all for this beer. Roastiness sustained on the shellfinish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Overall: I'd feared for a bizarre and unpleasant creation, but it was alright (at least for ten ounces worth).  ",4,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,3.74

Last Snow has always been one of my favorites, so the thought of trying that but essentially barrel aged, excited me. Despite my desire for more bourbon, the coconutty goodness that tickled my tastebuds made it permissible that it wasn't as profound. Not too much heat but not overly sweet either. If you can attain one of these, it is worth it.  ",4.75,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,4.85

Nose is huge coconut and coffe with vanilla and some bourbon. Taste is straight coconut and chocolate. Just outstanding. Finish leaves vanilla and dark chocolate coconutty goodness. Weirdly it doesn't come off overly sweet like it's going to break your teeth (ala Black Tuesday) just perfectly sweet with all of that toasted coconut. If you get a chance to try this do not hesitate.  ,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.25,4.75,4.67

171157,utopiajane,2016-08-08,"   The pour is sultry yellow with a big head of white foam that dwindles. The color has a little golden edge to it. A stream of bubbles, soft haze. Fruity with melon husks sweet grasses and light lemon. It's fragrant with a soft flower petal and the nutty perfume from the spelt malt is like the musk on this citrusy fruity beer. Sharp little bit of pepper. Drinks softly and very elegant. The malt sinks into a bit of crackery softness with a touch more flavor than you were expecting. the citrus becomes prominent in the drink but it's heady with dry lemon. Sweet grasses and alight touch of sugar finish this one dry and with a subtle cheek from bitterness. It's put together very well and has the perfect bubble. You don't notice any bite and the malt is very lush to the palate. I think there is a little dry funk on this beer too but I can't prove it. This is a lovely, malty saison with a bit of nutty flavor from the spelt malt and a vivacious late hop addition gives it presence on the nose. What I like about this style of beer is that it has a hearty character. The fruit is not easy to name and has a quality that sometimes I think you can only define by a color. Cool green like melon, mixed with a peppery herbal , lemon, a touch of tartness - its' all compliments and that's balanced. The bittering hop is strong and could take you to the aspirin like bitterness in a DIPA like heady topper, but in this one it's softer than that. It does have a sharpness. This is not a big IPA with lots of slick feeling to the body so a crisp sharp bitterness accents dryness. It lingers but not longer than the faintly nutty malt and with the light lemon in the aftertaste. Your palate is not all the way reset because of the spelt and the sugar. You want to pair this beer with aged or soft cheeses and a variety of artisan breads and sandwich boards, smoked turkey with melted cheddar and apples.  ",3.75,3.75,3.75,4,4,3.83

171157,StonedTrippin,2016-07-04,"   fashioned as a session saison, this is pretty good beer, sort of a session pale meets like a belgian single or light wheat beer. its not real interesting on the yeast front, clean and fruity, more belgian than farmhouse to me, a little acidic, white wine, peach, that sort of thing, but much more hop than yeast driven anyway. juicy limey zesty citrus hops, plenty of bitterness too, really stands out in such a light beer. clearish looking too for something called a saison, but its cleanness is a nice feature in hot weather, it drinks lighter than even it is, and the flavors are rather robust. i taste a little less of the wheat malt than i usually like to in a saison style, but it does have just a bit of body to it, so its contribution isnt that minimal. i love the freshness and citrus forward hop flavor, coming on real late and lingering nicely. likely mosaic and citra, or some similar combination. great carbonation and very refreshing overall. not the most out there or adventurous brew, which i really have come to expect and look forward to from these guys, but its well made and easy drinking and perfect for summer.  ",3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.78

S: a lot of bourbon on the nose. not off putting, but very present. vanilla, chocolate, smoke, dark licorice, oak. T: chocolate, this is a very sweet brew. i assume that has something to do with the maple syrup which also has a presence. coffee notes in there as well. sweet brown sugar. alcohol is moderate and there is virtually no bitterness in this.

101228,StJamesGate,2013-10-17,"   Dark straw with a fading snowy head that leaves the odd trailer. Big juicy citrus nose with some MO doughiness underneath. Biscuit with bossy pink grapefruit, lychee, goosberry and light resin hops jumping right in. Lime curd ending and minty linger. Light, crisp, slight chew, no burn, a bit of oil. Nugget, Centennial, Cascade and Citra. BBD 25.Jul.2014, so coming up near the end of 3 months freshness. It's certainly got the hopping right - there are all sorts of angles to this combo, with Centennial and Citra representing the most - making it very refreshing, especially with no heat. But i's pale and thin for the strength (by Brit standards, anyway) and the bitterness is a bit powdery which is not quite a flaw, but not on point either. And it's in no way - IBUs, aroma, ABV - a DIPA. Solid, above average American IPA but given the brewery, I expected more somehow.  ",3.5,3.75,4.25,3.75,4,3.99
101228,crnipeter,2013-10-10,"   Pours clear golden-yellow with a finger of off-white cap that sets at medium pace. Nose is lychee, citrusy and spicy hops, banana esters reminiscent of Hefeweizen (a brief look at the back-label confirms the assumption that wheat-malt has been used in this one) and there's only subdued malt aroma. Flavor is lemony with very restrained pale malt character. There's a pleasant lasting retronasal oflaction provided by hops. No harshness nor oaky flavors as it should be and absolutely no signs of being 7%. Light with creamy texture (wheat) and substantial carbonation. Doesn't seem very much like an Imperial one but flawlessly crafted nonetheless. (A presumably fresh bottle without BB indication, into tulip.)  ",3.5,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.82

Not as smooth as I like my BB beers to be, but this is a style I don't often have in a barrel-aged form. Body was medium, smooth, hot, but not too hot, appropriate carbonation.

I'm getting caramel along with the bourbon. The finish is also quite sweet. Mouthfeel: The body is a bit on the syrupy side with foamy carbonation and a dry finish.

The foam is gone about 30 seconds after the can empties. The aroma is a nice mix of malts, some roasted malt, some milk chocolate, and a good dose of brown sugar. The first sip reveals a silky smooth textured beer with fine soft carbonation. I get a bit of sweet coating across my palate with each sip. The flavor is roasted malt, some sweet chocolate, and a bit of brown sugar again. The beer doesnt reveal any hops and the booze is incredibly well hidden throughout the finish of the beer. This is an easy drinking sweet and smooth stout with no hits of booze and no hops to note either. No flaws on a straightforward sweet stout.  ",3.5,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,3.89

179485,Jeffo,2016-01-27,"   Got this one from dboon in a recent swap. Thanks for the FL brews man! From a bomber into a snifter Imperial porter aged in Bourbon barrels with coconut, coffee and natural flavors added Imperial version of Last Snow APPEARANCE: Pours thicker, opaque, dark brown/black and yields a cascading 2+ finger, medium looking, slightly creamy tan head with good retention. Black body with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a thick, creamy cap. Slight wisp remains til the end leaving touches of lacing down the glass. SMELL: Big nose of bourbon barrel on the pour. Sweet vanilla cream, coconut, milk chocolate, oak notes and bourbon on the nose. A hint of sweet, creamy coffee in there under the barrel and vanilla aromas as well. Bold sweet vanilla, coconut and barrel. Smells great. TASTE: Sweet vanilla cream, milk chocolate, oak and bourbon up front. Flavorful for sure. A whiff of coconut at the swallow moving into a bold and persistent aftertaste of oak, bourbon, vanilla, coconut, milk chocolate and a hint of bitter coffee in there too. A touch of booze but not much. Lots of sweet flavor with a solid barrel character and a hint of coffee still. Well balanced and interesting. Really good. PALATE: Medium – full body and lower levels of carbonation. Creamy enough on the palate, enough weight for sure, goes down smooth with a bit of a scratch and finishes mouth-coating. A touch of heat lingers. OVERALL: This is great. A wonderful imperial porter and the barrel definitely compliments the coconut additions really nicely. The coffee could be a little stronger perhaps, but that might also be the result of age. Regardless, it’s decadent the way it is right now. Lots of wonderful aroma and flavor with a strong, full feel to support it all. As good as Last Snow is, in this case, bigger is better really does ring true. Definitely jump on this one if you get the chance. Thanks again for the beers dboon. Highly recommended.  ",4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.47

A- Pours a 99% opaque black color with a 1/4 inch light brown head that retains a bit before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a half sheet of sheer surface foam. Resilient lacing leaves a solid ring behind. S- An intense wave of coconut, bourbon and coffee washes through my nasal cavity sending signals of immense pleasure to my cerebral cortex. T- The sheer intensity of deliciousness that's brought on by this already magnificent beer treated with lovely bourbon complexity is near-crippling. Very sweet with the coconut blending with the vanilla notes from the barrel, then the coffee provides its balancing roast on the back end. Coconut is definitely the main player after multiple sips are taken and that's the main lingering flavor. There's also chocolate, caramel and cake batter coming along for the ride. M- Silky smooth, luscious, decadent. Also a bit syrupy. Medium-low carbonation and a full body. O- My first perfect 5. Nothing about this beer can be improved. If I could drink this every day for the rest of my life, I don't think I would ever get sick of it. Beautiful...just beautiful.  ",5,5,5,5,5,5
82852,sbb32,2015-08-08,"   L- very dark brown, bordering as black. Nice brown head. S- subtle roast with a kick of brine. T- following along with smell. Plenty of cocoa up front that dominates the beginning. But as you swallow, lobster brine starts attacking. F- lobster (pleasantly) lingers. Did I just drink a beer or eat a po boy? Carb is quite pleasant as well O- glad I got to try what is a World of Beer exclusive. Definitely one of a kind. One wouldn't think lobster and chocolate would go well together, but Dogfish Head pulled it off wonderfully.  ",5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.36

125646,Damian,2016-02-05,"   Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Monson, MA 01 27 16 Served in a snifter A finger tall, frothy white crown topped the opaque, orangey-amber liquid. Although the beer is called ""Haze,"" the body on this could clearly be categorized as ""cloudy."" In fact, it looked very much like orange juice. The head quickly fell to a barely there film. Drippy streaks of lacing trickled down the glass. The aroma was really hoppy and bright. Tropical fruits came through strong right off the bat. Loads of passionfruit. Good amount of mango. Peach notes were apparent as well. Lots of zesty orange and orange peel. Juicy and fruity. As the beer sat, the orange notes took over. Later, the peach really came forth. The flavor profile was solid but more pithy and simple than the nose. Intense citrus notes. Orange peel dominated. Really juicy and fresh. Just a touch bitter. Peach notes also came through strong. Bit of mango. White grapefruit appeared in the finish. Fairly rind-like and moderately bitter. Some pithiness lingered after the swallow. On the palate, the beer was medium bodied. Perhaps a bit thinner than anticipated. The liquid contained a very fine, mellow effervesce that tuned the beer creamy and frothy on the palate. This almost felt a bit under carbonated. Haze is a really solid, citrus-forward double IPA, but it is far from Tree House's most impressive hoppy offering. By most accounts, this would be an amazing shelf beer, but by Tree House standards it was a bit disappointing.  ",4.25,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,4.29

263876,jkblr,2017-03-02,"   Sun King Lupulin Astronaut. 16 oz canned 12/18/16 6.5% ABV with mosaic, chinook & mandarina. Purchased 2/8/17 at the Fishers taproom. Poured into Sun King Rastal craftmaster one glass. Pours a golden color with shortlived white head. There are some floaties, but I would not call this beer hazy by any means. Smells like tropical fruit and citrus rind. Taste is more of the same with orange, and herbal dankness coming first then fading to bitterness at the end. Carbonation is high and feel is a bit thin to make this a world class contender. Overall, a good, drinkable APA that has just falls short of the standard bearing APAs available in the Midwest.  ",3.5,4,4,3.5,3.75,3.87

The aroma is full of citrus with just a hint of malt sweetness. The taste starts out with nice grainy sweetness followed by grapefruit rind. The finish is smooth and bitter The body is medium and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Great stuff but the flavor procile doesn't seem radically different from Frye's Leap.  ,4,4,3.5,4,4,3.8

47658,eppie82,2015-12-31,"   Three pours on draft at Founders of CBS '17 and also from bottle on a separate occasion. Very similar to CBS when I had it 2 years ago. The word that continues to come to mind is 'balance'. Definitely picking up chocolate, maple, coffee and the bourbon, but none of the ingredients are overpowering the other. This beer definitely gets better if you let it warm closer to room temperature. If you're looking for a maple bomb, this isn't it. It's not a barrel aged stout with maple added. It's a stout aged in bourbon barrels that previously housed maple, so it is much more subtle. Thoroughly enjoy this beer. ------------------------- Four pours on draft at Founders Brewery on 12/29/2015. A perfect stout. If you ever get a chance to acquire it or have it on draft, do not pass on opportunity. Dark black color, with a light layer of foam head upon pour. The nose reminds of Breakfast Stout base but with more complexity with the maple coming through. Taste is delicious and pleasant on the palate with, again, Breakfast Stout base being obvious but the maple sweetness note unmistakably coming through as it warms. Shockingly smooth! There is zero hint of booziness. Just delicious with all the ingredients I look for in a stout, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, maple sweetness. Phenomenal.  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.6

47658,M_chav,2015-12-24,"   Pours a black tar shadow. Tiny small bubble forms on the rim, no foamy head. The bubbles are a mocha brown and dissipate quickly. Aroma is intense maple/chocolate/coffee in that order. The maple smells so strong, makes for a sweet tooth boner. reminds me initially of Good Morning, but this smells richer and thicker. Plenty to love about this smell, I'm ready for a sugar bomb! Delicious, awesome bourbon vanilla balance. Now the coffee comes through and its beautiful.. Every flavor incorporated in the making of this beer is felt in even the smallest sip. There are no layers of different flavors here, everything is a pure mix and compliments itself. huge maple,coffee,rich chocolates, and bourbon sweetness to die for. Some will probably knock the (I'm not going to call it thin because it's not) mouthfeel, because we all probably crave the molasses/chewy BCBS style. But this beer is so damn easy to drink, make sure to take your time and let it warm up. Definitely an amazing beer, so awesomely crafted and balanced, very rich - just a pleasure to finally get my hands on a white whale like this. Was at first sad to trade away one of my favorite beers to obtain it, but in the end it was worth the price.  ",4.5,5,4.75,4.5,5,4.82

Aroma was decadent, coffee, maple, bourbon, chocolate, oak. The maple sweetness, heavy roasted malt, bitterness, chocolate, wood, and coffee in a lesser way, all really make for an insanely drinkable brew. Mild tobacco notes counter balance.

47658,Sabtos,2015-12-21,"   While the first time I rated this was at a Founders event at The Brew Kettle, this full, updated review is based upon the December 2017 release, fresh and on draft. I'm actually struck by how smooth, rich, deep and velvetty thick this is, with a soft but faint carbonation that concludes semi-dry and sticky. On top of that much improved body over KBS, it's also a bit sweeter, and the maple is more pronounced than the previous version I had, but it's not outstanding. Whiskey is still present, with a Jack Daniels-like sting, and there's not a lot of roastiness, but more of that tangy cola and bourbon heat. Maybe there's some chocolate fighting through, but there's no coffee at all, which is sad. Smell is more whiskey forward than the palate, but is otherwise fairly identical. CBS actually gets hotter as it warms, which is a detracting attribute from my standpoint.  ",4,3.5,4,4.25,4,3.91

Amazing nose, a huge coconut punch, but taste didn't follow. Flavors were artificial, very little barrel presence, light coffee in a medium porter body. * Possibly the best coconut nose I've ever sniffed from a bottle. Wow, straight up Almond Joy candy bar smell. Mouthfeel and flavors though were short of spectacular, the type I expected from Prop '13 given how much attention this beer has gotten. It's thin, almost no barrel to speak of in the flavor, coconut was very prominent, but felt flat, similar to Perrin No Rules.  ",4.5,5,4.25,4,4.5,4.47

Smells spicy, some lavender type flowers, darker malt backbone though so it's not as bright as Le Git for example. Taste is malty with a rye like spicy malt backbone, mild flavors overall, slightly tangy. Decent body but could use a little more carbonation. Less good than the other new Jackie O's saisons but still pretty solid. 6.5/10  ",3.5,3.5,3.25,3,3.25,3.3

85598,biboergosum,2015-09-26,"   650ml bottle, another one of those offerings that you only come across with you deign to visit the less discerning bottleshops around town, and have a heady sense of cognitive dissonance about the business practices of one Minhas Brewing, et al. This beer pours a rather solid black hole of colour, with very subtle basal cola edges, and three fingers of puffy, rocky, and foamy brown head, which leaves but a few instances of cannonball splash lace in places around the glass as things lazily and sloppily recede. It smells of more bitter than sweet cocoa powder, the sort that's been sitting on a discount store shelf for who the hell knows how long, gritty pale malt, a weak caramel sweetness, a bit of wan black licorice and earthy root-like character, and slightly sour cream. The taste is still quite chocolaty in that weak-ass dime-store manner - flaky and filmy, if ya get my poor student days drift - sour pale and still understated caramel malt, wayward sugary notes of the American military industrial complex ilk, a bland anise spiciness, increasingly off-seeming milky notes, and a twinge of unhinged booziness. The carbonation is quite light and ineffective at making me care about this usually frothy metric right now, the body a so-so middleweight, and plainly smooth, I suppose, with the cocoa at least providing a bit of further utility. It finishes just a tad off-dry, the same near-sickly chocolate taking us home in the same manner as it done brung us to this particular soiree. Sort of average all around, which for the brewery in question here, is way above their normal pedigree, I gotta say. Nothing special, but yeah, there's chocolate, and an otherwise basic stout kickin' about here, so, if you're into sub 4-dollar instances of such a thing, then, my peeps, this one is for you. Just don't be calling me to bitch about it in the fucking morning.  ",3.75,3,3,3,3,3.05

A - shiny pitch black with a tall mocha head that retained respectably S - significant dark chocolate and roasty aromas, some syrupy sweet notes, a touch of booze, and a faint hint of sourness T - there is a strange mix of sour milk and corn syrup that hits you hard, then moves to a cocoa and slightly musty flavour, dark fruit and roastiness towards the end, but it is dominated by the strange flavour up front M - medium body and appropriate carbonation, has a somewhat dry cocoa or chaulky feel O - this started with such promise and had me hoping but once again with these guys there seems to always be some kind of weird funky unwelcome aspect to the flavour that kills it  ",4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.03

Aroma of honey, florals, tangerine and mint. A mix of sweet and hoppy. Muted hop flavor upfront, not very bright, mix of florals and tangerine and mint (sound familiar?), some grapefruit and tangerine. Semi-sweet honey malt rides beneath.

There has been a recipe change for this beer, it is now a German-inspired Hefeweizen, not a Belgian-inspired Witbier. The recipe now seems to be much the same as their ordinary Hvedeøl, only with organic ingredients. Some sediment in the bottle. Cloudy pale yellow colour, huge white head.

Orange marmalade, pine, and a sweetness that might be agave. More orange, pine, some dank, and a good dose of sweetness. It's on the malty side with hints of earthy, sweet agave. The bitterness is medium, citric, and helps offset the sweetness. Thin to medium bodied, moderate carbonation, satisfying. This is kind of a sleeper IPA to me.

215485,StonedTrippin,2016-08-11,"   for me this was far and away the best beer they had pouring when i was there. its a sturdy porter with a huge roast profile to it, and then a serious adirondack campfire smoke as well. maybe double smoke because there are two smoked malts in here? its certainly robust enough to be a possibility. near black in color but not real heavy on the body, lower in alcohol too, especially for how much flavor there is in here. the smoke isnt acrid like it can be in some, and its not all iodine tasting like some rauch types can be, its clean in the finish, maybe adding a little bitter, but its smooth and not harsh at all, like a quality tobacco burning low. less of the sweet caramel malt middle here, just lots of roast, coffee grinds, soil, this one makes the most sense in terms of place for these guys, and its also easily their most inventive and original brew they have going. i hope this is the direction they settle in to, north country beers with some creativity, that would go over real well up there i reckon. if i went back today this is all i would drink...  ",,,,,,3.88

82852,StonedTrippin,2014-10-05,"   perhaps one of the stranger beers ive ever seen or tasted, a stout type brewed with cocoa and actual maine lobsters. i can imagine sam here dropping live lobsters into the kettle, oyster stout style, and its both haunting and hilarious in different ways. the resulting beer is an interesting product, dark and bitter from all the grain, heavy and slick in the feel from the protein of the fish, and honestly fishy and briny in the end, but never gross like a can of sardines. its more of a mellow fishiness, like actual lobster meat, sweet and buttery even without the drawn butter. the stout though is really bitter, so there is a contrast there, and all the body without much carbonation makes it a little tough to get through even a short pour. still, while i dont really want to drink this beer, i have to respect it for what it is. i know there are some who are down on the dogfishs and the mikkellers of the world for unbridled experimentation, often to the point of absurdity, but not me. you never know until you know, and now we know...  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.48

82852,Slatetank,2013-08-19,   I had this brewpub exclusive at the pub in Rehoboth served chilled in a snifter. The color is dark brown almost black with opaque clarity and thin tan ring for head. The smell is very good with dark cocoa and a fresh basil aroma with mild malt sweet scent and light roast. The feel is excellent with semi-dry malt body and creamy yet slightly oily feel from the herbal texture of basil mixed with a yeast accent and mild bitterness with moderate carbonation and low alcohol influence with dry finish. The taste is unique the most basil flavor I think I have ever had in a chocolate beer - but plenty of dark cocoa in the taste with some dry maltiness and low bitterness and mild malt sweetness backing up the spice and herbal elements. There is some mild crustacean in the ale which is generally perceived as mineral with basil lasting into the pungent and roasted finish. Overall this is a great porter with the adjunct of chocolate and basil providing a complimentary taste that works well with lobster bringing it all together. I was not sure what to expect but this went well with white chocolate cherry bread pudding for dessert.  ,3.75,4,3.75,4.25,4,3.91

Additional scents of salt and light spice. This must be the lobster. The flavor is nice. Sea salt and chocolate with a dry finish. Some Irish stout character.

82852,drabmuh,2012-07-19,"   On tap at Rehoboth Beach pub, this beer is mostly chocolate and no lobster. Beer is black and brown with a nice brown head of small bubbles, nice looking beer. Aroma is chocolate and mild roast, a little sweetness. Beer is medium in body and very bitter on the end with the chocolate. Lobster? nope. Salty? nope. Just a nice porter, probably a waste of lboster although I imagine the lobster probably ended up tasting like the beer...not the other way around.  ",4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.83

47658,Chris_H_2,2015-12-01,"   In the interests of full disclosure, this had been one of my wants for a long time. When I finally got it (fall '14), I was worried it would've fallen off considerably. But much to my delight (and pleasant surprise), it tasted amazing and held up extremely well, especially compared to the CBS I had on tap in spring '15. Just a great beer all around. Poured from a 750 ml bottle A - pours dark black with little head (very similar to KBS, which is not a surprise) S - mmm, smell that maple sweetness; there is a hint of chocolate as well, but not many coffee notes T - lots going on (maple, vanilla, some chocolate notes), but with the aging, you can actually taste the base beer instead of a bourbon bomb. There is sweetness, but it's not sugary. The bourbon has mellowed considerably, and is less noticeable than the fresher beer on tap. MF - much like KBS. This isn't a very viscous beer, and if you're looking for a BCBS feel, you're not going to get it. O - an overall amazing beer, and I would go out of my way every time to get it on tap.  ",4.5,5,5,4.25,4.75,4.85

In all likelyhood, I?ll never get the chance to find out. ** 12/13/17 On tap at Unos. LOOK: dark black with a medium off white head. Looks thick swirling in glass. AROMA: smoke, maple, and coffee beautifully mixed. TASTE: The simple roasted malt comes out first like you would get from a straight RIS. The sweetness of the maple and touches of oak, whiskey, fudge and coffee round out the back end. Really Awesome. FEEL: Not super thick, but full bodies.

125646,CTbrew32,2016-01-27,"   Canned: 1/27/16 Appearance- Pours a foamy two finger head. Orange in color and incredibly hazy and dense. No visibility whatsoever. Aroma- Pineapple, guava, sweet grapefruit, a little spicy/herbal, and a bready malt. Taste- Big fruity hops upfront with pineapple, orange, and citrus being most notable. Middle sees some grapefruit flavor and bitterness set in. The finish is very dry with a big bready malt rounding things out. Feel- Very soft,medium bodied, medium carbonation, and a dry finish with some oily hops lingering. Overall- Really enjoy the Treehouse Ipa's that strike a balance between juicy hops and a soft feel but with some tradtional hop flavors (grapefruit in this case) and solid bitterness. This hits both those marks (as does Green) which really makes this so enjoyable. Only knock is that once it warms up the hop flavor dies down a little and sweet bready/doughy malt really comes out. 11/13/2016 Notes: Seems like the grapefruit aspect has been abandoned with this beer, with a heavier emphasis on sweet citrusy flavors. A little heavy on the sweetness, but still an excellent dipa.  ",4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25

125646,boilermakerbrew,2016-01-17,"   A- Pours just like the rest of the Tree House IPA's, hazy as hell and bright to boot. This time, the color is a bright, light orange to almost peach or apricot in color. A smaller head forms and retains for a bit, but only laces a little bit. Overall impression in the glass is that it looks a lot like a mimosa at a Sunday brunch. S- The first hit on the nose is a punch of fruity and citrus hops that turns slowly toward a mild bitterness in the back half of the smell. This is really a unique smelling beer for a double IPA because it has almost no malt in the scent and also doesn't have an overpowering hop bitterness. Peach, tangerine, apricot, and light orange mix in with light bitterness to provide a very enticing overall scent. T- When this beer hits the tongue, it follows somewhat of an inverted flavor arc as the scent. A mild to moderate hop bite greets the tongue first before the flavor turns more toward the citrus in the scent. The middle portion of the drink is very citrus forward, with many of the same flavors as the smell had. Right at the end of the drink the hops bitterness returns and lingers with a light, but still citrus forward, bitterness. M- Man, if no one told me, I might have guessed this is an APA from just the weight of the beer. It isn't light on the tongue, but it also isn't thick and heavy. The carbonation is moderate to slightly elevated, and combined with the weight of the beer, this drinks very easily. No alcohol is detectable in either taste or feel of the beer. Overall, this is a very unique beer in the style category. Usually I expect at least a little bit of malt in a DIPA, but this one is all fruity and citrus light hop bitterness. I really enjoy this beer.  ",4.75,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.55

112233,mfnmbvp,2014-12-03,"   22 oz. bottle, with no apparent bottled on date present. The local beer store is still holding down bottles of this, so I thought I'd give it a go. My first big bottle from Capital Brewery; this one a 'rum barrel-aged brown ale'. 8.50% abv according to the label. Aged for six months in Jamaican rum barrels. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. A - It pours a hazy caramel / ruby colored body with a half finger of tan head that falls to a ring quickly. Leaves behind scattered patchy lacing. Some fine sediment visible when held to the light. Looks very nice. S - Initial booziness gives way to a slight acetic vinegary tartness, but pleasant in my opinion. Lightly tart & musty smelling. Notes of wood, oak, vanilla, and light band-aid. I can definitely see where the tropical rum notes have taken effect here. T - An initial light sour / tartness hits you, but it subsides to waves of caramel, vanilla, wood, green apples, & dried earthy fruitiness. The tart is very enjoyable, in my opinion, and integrates well with the rest of the flavors. M - The feel is smooth, creamy, & tart. Lingering notes of vanilla and tart fruitiness. Lightly coarse carbonation, but very easy-drinking for the 8.50% abv. Overall, I'd certainly say that the rum barrel-aging has done it's thing - for good or for ill. I am of the opinion that it is rather enjoyable, and I am liking this beer quite a lot. Certainly a unique and different beer experience, which is always something I am on the look out for. While perhaps not the most pristine example of a barrel aged brown ale, I'd recommend this one. Keep on with more experimentation like this, Capital Brewery.

108127,jlindros,2015-12-27,"   Thanks to rudzud Pours a decent foamy dark creamy head forced pour, light lacing fades fairly quickly, pitch black long legs. Nose weird spices, allspice, ginger, cinnamon, herbal weird buttery thing, perhaps diacetyl, cumin and curry, little minty chocolate thing, little caramel char, it's all over the place. Taste brings more cocoa dark chocolate, creamy milk chocolate, little anise and mint, more spices finger cinnamon anise, little cumin, bitter spices and herbal hops, little sour milk, little roasty, little booze warmth. Finish sticky little more booze warmth, lingering spices, cocoa, roasty etc. Mouth is heavier bod, little creamy, boozy, decent carb. Overall eh, spices weren't very good, and other strange characters.  ",4.25,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.52

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a dark brown nearly black with a thin mocha head that fades to leave light thin wisps and a light halo. S - Aromas of chocolate, ginger, cinnamon, little anise, allspice. T - Taste is similar to the nose. Lots of Indian spices, ginger, cinnamon, allspice. Maybe a little mint too. Almost yogurt like taste. Decent chocolate. M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, alcohol hidden well. O - Overall this beer was rather unique. Loads of ginger and cinnamon.

If it were toned down a bit, it would be excellent. The stout really gets drowned out. Could use a little more heat from the peppers too. It is what I would describe as an unbalanced Xocaveza. It would be a good holiday beer.  ",4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.67

82852,rab53,2012-07-09,"   Stopped by the DFH brewpub in Rehoboth twice last week while on vacation. Porter brewed with 40 whole lobsters, chocolate and basil? Sounds like trouble, but is a must try. Medium brown with thin white head. Some roasted malts come through in the nose, along with a unique brininess. How different is a 'lobster porter' from an 'oyster stout' really? The basil is not noticeable. Smooth and easy-drinking (my wife even ordered it again). Carbonation is on par with the style. Overall, better than most of DFH's bottled offerings.  ",4,4,4,3.5,4,3.95

M: smooth, medium body, low carbonation O: not much lobster flavor, but a pretty good brew overall.

Pours a dark foamy fizzy 1/2 finger head that fades fairly quickly, long legs, pitch black beer. Nose is incredible, just loads and loads of coconut, big creamy coconut, dark chocolate toasted cocoa, coconut cream, little caramel, nougat, dark malt, etc, just the epitome of gourmet mounds bar in beer form, great toasted oak, vanilla, hint coffee, touch of sweet bourbon. Incredible! Taste starts thick and fudgey, creamy thick chewy dark chocolate oats, fudgey cocoa, big fudgey feel, little fluffy nougat, chocolate syrup. Then into coconut, not as much as the nose but plenty of nice coconut, mild caramel candy biscuity note, dark choc cocoa, light coffee wish it was a bit more, coconut milk and husk note. Vanilla oak barrel, toasty, light bourbon, no booze either. Finish lots more chocolate and coconut, toasted coconut and vanilla barrel, flash of bourbon. Mouth is fuller bod, big silky creamy oatmeal chewy fudgey feel, nice fluffy carb. No booze. Overall incredible! My mind's eye remembers Buffalo as incredible and probably about as good as this.  ",4.5,5,4.75,5,4.75,4.82

A: Opaque jet black, looks thick on the pour. Less than 1 fingers width of very dark tan head, which dissipates quickly and leaves only a few small patches of lacing and some alcohol legs. 4.75 S: Wow. Luscious aroma. Chocolate fudge, subtle coffee, decent amount of coconut but aroma is not a coconut bomb like Last Snow. Huge barrel notes too, charred oak and vanilla. Near perfect. 5 T: Incredible. Super sweet but not cloying. Rich chocolate, some coffee bitterness, sweet vanilla, coconut on the finish. Barrel notes prominent and tie it all together with charred oak and bourbony booze. 4.75 M/D: Silky smooth, carbonation appropriate, ABV exceptionally well masked, drinkability is excellent. 5 O: My 800th beer review and this is one of the best beers I’ve ever had.

179485,alerxovawo,2015-11-26,"   Blown away yet again by this Funky Buddha offering. Upon opening the bottle you are blown away by the smell of toasted coconut and sweet bourbon. Smells absolutely decadent. Coffee doesn't play a huge role in the nose until it warms. Pour is dark black and viscous with a small light brown head. Very nice lacing. The taste is out of this world. Sweet coconut is up front with a beautiful bourbon taste mingling in the mix. The bourbon plays a much bigger role here than in Morning Wood. Coffee comes through subtly in the finish and cuts the sweetness perfectly. Not cloying whatsoever. I know it's been said before, but this tastes like dipping a mounds bar in bourbon. Nothing short of spectacular. Never had a better coconut flavor in a beer. All the flavors blend perfectly. Mouthfeel is full, slick, and viscous. Almost chewy. So happy I have another bottle to enjoy in the future. Seek this out with reckless abandon! You will be blown away.  ",4.5,5,5,4.75,5,4.95

True to style, this is sweet with a brown sugar flavor with lots of banana. The swallow brings out the first indication of wheat along with a good dollop of hop bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel with lighter carbonation of fine bubbles.  ",,,,,,3.98

Taste is just like the smell, very fruity, apples, peaches, pineapple and mangos are all there, balanced by a biscuity, malt backbone and just a touch of grassy earthiness. Texture is light but very creamy with medium carbonation, very juicy. Overall in terms of taste, texture, look and smell this beer delivers the quality you expect from Treehouse beers, i would drink this all the time if i could.  ",4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25

Mellowed malt and booze take over the aroma. Molasses and vanilla blend together. It's a bit too much for me at this point. The taste is very mellowed, but too sweet. Cloyingly so, the malts, caramel, and molasses just destroy anything I have left. The sweet booziness makes this not all that drinkable, thick on the plate with no carbonation. Not a huge fan.  ",4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.45

S: Melange of red fruit and wine barrel characteristics (oak and toasted coconut, cinnamon), some dark chocolate malt, maybe a soupcon of smoke. T: Fruit, red wine, oak, chocolate malt. A short, acidic punch at the end of the sip adds nice effect. A little alcohol bite at the end as well. M: Very light carbonation, fullish body. A little viscous/oily and with creamy chocolate texture. Perhaps a tad more carbonation would serve well. O: Seems like a mix between a stout and an old ale, each contributing its best characteristics to the blend. This avoids the overly sweet or fruitiness of some old ales.

Smell is boozy, hints of raisin and fig, touch of wooden barrel, very big. Taste is layered to perfection. It stands on the sweeter side, big notes of chocolate and molasses. Hints of rum soaked fruit in the middle. Finish is long and sticky, you can taste the maple syrup here along with some roasty notes. While it sits heavier in the stomach, this beer is really easy to drink. There's not a ton of carbonation and that's OK. It's a big beer that demands to be sipped and is super rewarding if you do so.

47658,BerkshireGuerrilla,2015-11-11,"   Just recently got this on draft, served in a snifter. It poured tar black with no head or lacing. The nose was filled with chocolate and toffee. Taste wise it was very chocolatey with a little coffee, definitely wasn't as warm/boozy as KBS and the bourbon notes are very subdued. I didn't get much maple flavor from it, subtle at best. Glad I tried it but definitely a lot of hype and not a lot of bite.  ",4.25,4,4,4.5,4,4.07

262369,woodychandler,2018-04-22,"   This is my seCANd true entry in Happy Damn You for Being with the Best Multiple New Hookers with Tea on Sunday When There's Beer, Bro. Woody! (Week 687). My seCANd of the day was me revisiting a Blonde Hooker, this time in the CAN. It's going to be a parade of Hookers at Chez Woody today! From the CAN: ""Character: Unconventionally Traditional""; ""Using the finest ingredients from all over the world, Passport Pilsner retains a traditional European style, augmented by American innovation. Malts from Germany, hops from the Czech Republic, and a uniquely American brewing style make this lager worth the trip."" I Crack!ed this Hooker but good & then turned her upside down for an inverted Glug & some light spanking. I vigorously swirled her around to produce three-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with great retention that left behind wonderful lacing as a reminder of her visit. Who doesn't like head? Color was a slightly hazy Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4). Nose was very grassy, hay-like & lemony with a biscuit malt base & so I sent out for Enrico's Lemon Biscotti during our first intermission. I feed my women as I like to ensure that there is fuel for the furnace. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, not watery, but nothing to get excited about. The taste was definitely Pilsner, but I thought that hop-forward = Czech Pils while malt-forward = GER Pils, no? This site's style guide seems to suggest an overlap. I only mention it because I now rate to style & not to taste after being called out by some jagov. At any rate, it was the type of Pils that I like - hop-forward with a hay, grassy, lemony spicy tang with the malt as a backup. yum! Baby, I am digging you! Finish was dry, again, right in my wheelhouse. This and the Blonde Hooker from earlier would make a good tag team tandem in my cooler, especially since they come in CANs.  ",3.5,4,4.25,3.25,3.75,3.95
262369,tone77,2018-03-11,"   Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a hazy golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, light lemons, a touch of sweetness. Taste is lemons, malts, a bit of grains, a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing beer.  ",4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.53
262369,NeroFiddled,2017-11-28,"   Thomas Hooker Brewing Company ""Passport Pilsner"" 12 fl. oz. can, ""BORN ON: 2017/05/08"" $2 @ Giant, Havertown, PA Notes via stream of consciousness: Hmmm, it's surprisngly hazy, almost cloudy. That's odd for a pilsner but I'm guessing this is unfiltered and they're going for more of a keller style. It's a deep golden in color with some orange highlights beneath a creamy head of white. The aroma is lightly spicy with a touch of lemon over a grainy malt base. It's fresh and bright and inviting. It's not what I think of as the ""classic Saaz hop Pilsner"" but neither does it have to be, I appreciate a bit of variance. The flavor is fairly bold, which is also a little bit surprising as I was expecting something a little more mainstream, combining sweetish grainy malt with spicy and herbal hops around a firm bitterness. I almost forgot the light note of lemon. It starts with that and finishes with more of the herbal, spicy, and at this point, earthy, hops. It lingers for a few moments as the malt fades and the bitterness rises then declines. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a zesty, crisp carbonation that livens the tastebuds. Looking back the head has held well, maintaining a thin, semi-broken surface covering and wide collar, and there's some very nice lacing left behind. I could live with this! I wish my sample was fresher but it's held up nicely. Worth trying.  ",3.75,4,4,4,3.75,3.94

262369,Vetbidder,2017-07-19,"   Almost see through but slightly hazy look with a nice white head on this beer. Beery malt scent with some noble type hops on the edge of the nose. I thought this was somewhat bitter and sort of pils like but doesn't have the distinct good spicy flavors like some of the better ones have. Medium of mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Overall, there are way better pils out there, would not revisit.  ",3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.54

On the nose this beer is true to the style, a bit grass like with a slight wisp of something sweet. Taste is clean and crisp hints of hops and a bitter dry finish. Overall a real nice pilsner.

347690,StonedTrippin,2018-05-25,"   a solid esb here, hoppier and fuller bodied than many, maybe not quite with as much drinkability as i like in a more classically fashioned example of the style, but i also like the liberties taken here, subtle as they are, and i think this is a well made beer for sure, my first from these guys, who i believe are relatively new to the scene. its light brassy copper color from the tap, with a short white head that settles back pretty quick. the aroma is a traditional maris otter type malt base, a little of that english crystal sweetness, and then a bittering hop note, fresh and green. the english yeast here is really mild, both the grains and the hops are in front of it, so its sort of a different kind of balanced than i am used to in the style, but i like the elevated malt character a lot, toffee and honey and bread notes to it without it being sweet or heavy. the hops are a little vegetal but the balance the grain well. smooth and round in feel, a little less carbonated than it could be, but a robust example of the style and an enjoyable glass of beer. nice to see some newcomers to the craft scene trying to save some of these english styles, sadly nobody is making this type of beer anymore. i will miss it when its gone...  ",,,,,,3.75

Decent amount of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt character. T: Heavy on the spices up front. Cinnamon again with a good amount of heat. Maybe chili pepper or perhaps even curry? Again with the ginger/cardamom following. Fairly heavy charry roasted malt with lots of chocolate throughout. Lingering cinnamon and chocolate in the aftertaste. Overall it sorta reminds me of a mexican hot chocolate. M: Heavy, thick and viscous. Smooth too. O: Interesting heavily spiced stout. It reminds me sorta of Indra Kunindra or Bombay Berserker. Indian-centric spices I would say. Pretty strong but not too overpowering. Very heavy and potent brew with strong flavors. Surprisingly smooth bodied with no real booziness though.  ",4.25,4,3.75,4.25,4,3.94

112233,OPJohn,2014-04-21,"   Poured into a shaker pint. A: Poured like a soda. A lighter Dr. Pepper brown with a fast fading head and no appreciable lacing to speak of. Big chunky bubbles. S: Smell was outstanding. Toffey, nutty and rum notes all over the aroma. I was impressed by the smell and very hopeful for a great flavor from this beer. T: Sour! I was taken aback because I didn't expect any sour notes from the beer. Definite Acetic acid taste from overuse of adjuncts (corn sugar) or liquid extract. You want to taste the rum and the wood from the barrels but its just overwhelmed by sour. Some nutty, bready gets through from classic malts but that's about it. Disappointed. M: Medium bodied with huge chunky bubbles. Drinkable but not as smooth and creamy as it could be. Probably force carbonated and would've perhaps been better bottle conditioned or brewed with cream ale yeast. O: Definitely drinks more like a Kentucky Common than a traditional brown ale. It would've completely fit the Kentucky Common style if it had a creamier head. Being as it wasn't billed as such, I have to give this one a fail.  ",2.75,4,2.5,2.75,3,3

Hard to find the malty brown ale beneath. Sugar, subtle banana taffy, and maybe a hint of coconut. T - A bit harsh with overpowering alcohol and rum. I wanted to taste the smooth malty brown with some nuttiness, but it is hard to find. Odd aftertaste. M - Light bodied with okay carbonation and kinda rough. Not very smooth. O - Well, this beer is okay, not what I hoped it would be. I think the base beer needs some work or the rum barrels ruined it. It's not bad, but it could be so much better. I was intrigued since I really enjoy brown ales and there are few that are aged barrels. I'd skip this one.  ",3.75,3.5,3,3.25,3,3.19

212675,maximum12,2016-04-01,"   Thanks to blacknyellow20 for this extra, a 12 oz. can that looks like it was actually designed, which isn’t so common in our little sandbox. The pour is burnt umber, big carbonation, with a smattering of chunks slowly drifting to the bottom of the glass. Suspended yeast? Dandruff? Bits of cherimoya? What the hell is cherimoya, anyways? Be right back…the nose is like agave nectar, no twist. Interesting. The Cherimoya Project – Kaffir Lime has gimmick written all over it. Unheard of fruit? Yeah, let’s pitch that into the wort! Fortunately, & rather surprisingly, the beer caught me off guard with the first sip of tastiness. The weird C-fruit still resembles agave to me, & the lime is just present enough for my tongue to probe. Post-fruit is crushed grain, ghostly yeast, moderate bitterness, & an almost mixed drink finish (& I haven’t had anything with a lime stuck to the lip of the glass in years). Dry & suckable, I’m going to wipe this twelve out in a hurry. I love surprises, especially good ones. A gimmick? Nah, just an excellent brew.  ",4,4,4,4,4.5,4.1

The foam disappears leisurely quickly and leaves little thin fine grooves. Smells generally plenty of fruits and very little yeast. The aroma of citrus, orange peel, herbs, grasses with a soapy touch. Also some passion that pushes ahead. Does not taste like it smells. Is a little fruity flavors of passion fruit, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon. Some herbs, grasses and some alcohol flavor. But even a small dishwasher taste that irritates. Medium body, somewhat marked bitterness, medium carbonation. A little sweet, with a horrible taste dishwasher.  ",,,,,,1.97

47658,TheElectricOne,2015-10-17,"   On tap at Doherty's Ale house, added from notes: Appearance: deep, obsidian black in body, with a tiny rim of dark brown on the edges when swirled. Thin, but persistent mocha-colored head, that dissipates after a minute or two into a slim collar around the edge of the glass. Aroma: One of the most balanced and delectable smelling stouts I've had. You can smell the maple and bourbon from a yard away, if not more. Upon closer sniffin' around, the beer has a layer of coffee roast in addition to the obvious and pungent maple and barrel scent. The whole bar smelled of CBS. Taste: one of my favorite types of beer, the maple stout. This one does not disappoint at all. Tastes like rich milk chocolate, with layer upon layer of decadent, dessert-y flavors. Bitter roast of coffee, vanilla and wood from the bourbon barrel, and lots of maple syrup. It's a fantastic, amalgamation of flavor. Feel: heavy and viscous, although it isn't as high in percentage as some double/imp stouts, it delivers fully in body. Overall: one of the top 10 beers I've ever tasted in all likelihood, and second only to Good Morning in terms of maple-y stouts.  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75
47658,RichD,2015-10-17,"   Had on tap. This was the white whale that I could have only dreamed of having since I had tasted my first craft beer 4-5 years ago. L: Pours a pitch, impenetrable black with a small dark khaki colored had that became nothing but a ring after a few second. I hold this up to the light and see nothing but black. S: Smells of coffee, alcohol (at first) and a faint maple sweetness. I pick up some chocolate as well. This smells very nice, but the initial pour that I had was colder than it should be. As this warmed, the aroma became more pronounced and the coffee and maple were able to shine. T: As previously mentioned, the initial pour was pretty cold which yielded some alcohol. I am rating this on what I tasted as this warmed. Coffee and sweet bourbon come through in a strong way. There is a sweetness that is brought forth by the maple syrup that makes this very desirable. The flavors mesh well together and the way this beer is constructed, each flavor is able to shine through throughout the experience. I have had more maple forward coffee stouts, but as a Founders barrel aged stout, I get exactly what I'm expecting, which is a smooth, well rounded stout. F: This feels higher than the 10.6% that Founders says this is. This is a thick, chewy stout, but it's pretty easy to drink. I was able to polish off 12 ounces of this in a relatively short time. As this warms, the alcohol presence predictably disappears and allows this stout to become smoother and well balanced. Overall: I had supremely high hopes for this beer. This was the beer that I dreamed to have when I first started getting into craft beer. I actually started drinking craft beer about a month after this beer was released. This beer had some sentimental value to me as it was released on the day that my grandmother passed away. I put this beer on my list of white whales with the understanding that I may never try this in my life. This beer lives up to the hype for me. It is not as coffee or maple forward as some other beers that I have had. However, CBS is a beer brings flavors together in a way that other breweries cannot do. I am completely satisfied and if I ever see this beer available again, I will not hesitate to order it.  ",5,5,5,5,5,5

76032,womencantsail,2011-12-06,"   On-tap at Strong Ale 2011 Pours a murky amber color with a fairly big tan head. Caramel, toffee, and chocolate are all present on the nose. There is a touch of old hop character as well as some notes of vanilla and oak. A decent fruitiness on the palate. Some oak and mild vanilla to go with the malt notes of chocolate, toffee, and caramel. Medium bodied with medium carbonation.  ",3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.72
59401,cudmud,2010-06-20,"   Appearance: Deep, gold color, very clear, with medium lace. Slight head of 1mm. Steady stream of bubbles. Overall, a handsome beer. Smell: Strong hop aroma, which smells mostly of grapefruit. Some malt comes through all the hops. Taste: Heavy hop flavor. Very little malt detected. Mouthfeel: Thick and cookie-like. Drinkability: One is very drinkable, but I don't know if I'd drink more than one a night. The name doesn't lie, it's hoppy.  ",,,,,,3.58

Nice tropical smells mostly of mango,also vanilla and passion fruit, with some sour sweet tart smells. Taste did not spill over from look/smell for me it was all bitter mango juice it overwhelmed this brew it then was mixed tart ripe pink grapefruit rind, a large amount of bitter hop juice was also present. Mouth feel very bitter with fruit rind and bitter hops a lingering tart sour finish. This brew was trying for to much it was not a good IPA or a Kettle sour IMO  ",,,,,,3.46

125646,LambicPentameter,2015-12-29,"   0% Received this as part of a trade from BA MVB1121. Making a point to review it after having it last time and loving it so much that I didn't want to take the time to write down my notes. Poured out of a tallboy that was canned on 11/24/15 and enjoyed just shy of a month on 11/24/15. Poured into a pub-style pint glass. Appearance (4.5) - Pours a radiant peachy-orange hue with an almost pinkish glow like you might see in some sunsets. The glow is a bi-product of all the particulate in suspension, creating a roiling cloud of hop matter that is dense up near the top of the glass and wafts down in a thick, lazy wisp at the bottom of the glass. Atop the liquid sits three fingers of off-white foam that leaves huge sticky patches on the sides of the glass as it dissipates. Smell (4.75) - There is a fair amount of fruit going on here--nectarine, peach, orange zest, but the thing that really draws me in is an herbal, stinks-so-good pungency that rises up out of the glass. I could sit here and smell it for quite awhile before ever needing to take a swig. Taste (4.5) - A let down comparative to the smell, but still a wonderfully juicy brew with predominant presence of orange and peach and an herbal spiciness that again has that same dankness from the aroma influencing the taste. There is none of the heightened bitterness and sweet booziness that will sometimes turn me off of the imperial variety of IPAs, but at a modest 8.2% abv, there isn't a ton of alcohol to compete with the huge hop profile. Some floral nectar undertones are there as it warms up a little bit, giving some nice depth to the fruity dominance. Mouthfeel (4.5) - Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and a juicy, full mouthfeel from the intense quantities of hop particulate in the liquid. Finish is semi-sweet with just a touch of lingering bitterness. Overall (4.5), yet another stellar entry from Tree House. The first IPA I've had from them that is a double, and while I personally tend to prefer single IPAs due to the fact that they have relatively less booze and are more drinkable, this is one of the most drinkable double IPAs I've had the pleasure of drinking. I could drink just this and Julius and have all my IPA needs filled for a long time.  ",4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.58

125646,Pourharddrinkslow,2015-12-28,"   Pours a (forgive me) ""hazy"" yellow gold color with a medium sized white head... nice lacing. Smell is that of peaches (!), mango, pine, and dank hops. Taste follows the nose, nice balance of hops and pine, and the most peach I have ever tasted in a beer. I was so caught off guard it took me a couple sips to figure out what I was tasting. Mouthfeel is that of a juicy, pretty thick for an IPA body, with a medium amount of carbonation. Overall this is an excellent DIPA, that incorporates flavors not commonly used in that style.  ",5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.71

Smell: Pine, turpentine. Taste: Boozy up front, with a chemical aftertaste. In between, pine bitter. Feel: Small bubbles, on the light side. Overall: The best Pig Minds bottled beer I've had yet. Having said that, I'm still not convinced any aspect of it came out the way they wanted---as if the attributes are simply what the brewers got, instead of being the intentional results of recipe design.  ",4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.87

T- a very big Peat and smokiness taste. The wine barrels are very present at the end of the taste. Definitely a big red wine presence as well. A very sweet finish. This would be great with a cigar.

Smells intensely peated, and chlorophenolic, with a hint of caramel sweetness. Taste is dominated by peaty smokiness, and has a sweet and earthy aftertaste. Feels smooth, medium bodied, medium carbonation, and leaves a slick residue and hides the alcohol fairly well. Overall, I would love this beer if it weren't for the singular off putting aroma, and I wish there were more notes to compare my results. Cheers!  ",4.25,3,4,4,4,3.78

47658,LAp,2015-09-12,"   Had this beer in a 12oz snifter at a KBS-CBS-Blushing Monk tasting event. Beautiful pitch black pour with a dark khaki head. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side like its other breakfast stout brethren. The syrupy-sweet of the maple syrup really builds on the (already excellent) smell of KBS, and adds another layer to the taste, but 4 or 5 ounces in, that sweetness starts to get cloying. Ultimately the maple syrup addition is a nice tweak to an already phenomenal base beer, but compounding the saccharine notes of bourbon with still-more-saccharine maple syrup was a little much for my tastes. Though I'd place the standard KBS higher on my personal list, this is the superior choice for anyone who wants to go sweeter still. Regardless, personal nitpicks aside, this is an incredible beer.  ",4.75,5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.69

Decently balanced brew with caramel malt backbone, but bitterness takes over quickly, mostly a grassy bitterness, faded citrus, guessing that's the lime. The bitter lasts but overall the brew has a sorta watered down flavor. Thin mouthfeel.  ",4.25,4,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.54

Smells of sweet caramel, a bit of grainy sweetness, floral and pine aromas, mild bit of citrus. Flavour is similar; a relatively non-descript caramel sweetness, touch of grain, citrus zest, bit floral, not much pine resin, clean but non-descript bitterness. Not bad, decent flavour profile, but a bit non-descript, even bland. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, crisp, refreshing, not too dry, slight resin and cereal sweetness on the finish.  ",3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.62

Smell of lime, breads malt and grass. A bit odd but not off putting. Taste mimics the nose. Very well balanced and uniquely tasty. Love the grassy lime mix. It works well. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is nice. Moderate carbonation provides a soft, easy drinking brew. Goes down easily. I am impressed. I grabbed a six pack on a whim and glad I did. I could crush a lot of these on a hot summers day. Recommended.  ",4,3.75,4.25,4,4,4.04

There's some fresh grass in the mix as well. Some pine as well. The malts are there to balance out the bitterness. Alcohol goes unnoticed. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with moderate carbonation.

157721,coryhula,2018-02-16,   Similar to Firestone Walker Stickee Monkee but a bit more unrefined boozy finish. 13.1ABV so apparently a different year the original posting here. No head whatsoever. Brown sugar/toffee/molasses/caramel flavors. A bit of a grainy feel on the tongue. I'd likely buy again at $14/bottle -- not a bad value if you're looking for a decent barley wine.  ,4,4,3.75,4.25,4,3.93

58531,BarrytheBear,2011-11-18,"   12 oz bottle courtesy of Mile High Liquors during my summer road trip to Denver. Bottle reads ""Old Gaffer Barley Wine Ale"" and shows 10% abv, which differs a percentage point from what this site says. Anywho... Short lived head atop a clear dark copper body. Tiny bubbles swirl in a lazy dance. Patchy lacework creeps slowly back to the depths keeping the glass mostly clean. Smell is a rush of dark fruits: plums, figs, dates, and black raisins. Not sure if this is barrel aged, but there's a spiced cider quality here as well. Rum? Smells hot but enticing. Dark fruits here as well along with toffee. A snake of heat winds its way from front to back with a viper sharp sting throughout coupled with mulling spices. I can see this being quite nice with some aging. Very woody and drying on the finish. This must have spent time in a barrel as it's all over the finish. Quite tannic. Overall, the Gaffer could stand some additional time in the cellar. The hots are distracting, but the underlying flavors hint at a really nice English Barleywine. If you only have a single bottle, I'd recommend some patience, but i like the potential here.  ",3.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.09
58531,JayS2629,2011-09-05,"   Poured as a guest beer at Trinity Brewpub in Colorado Springs. It pours a rich honey toned color with great clarity, a medium head that fades fast into a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. The aroma has a warm booziness in the background lurking through honey, caramel and vanilla. Rich, malty smells with toffee. Woody notes of oak and some floral hints. The flavor was intense and rich. Orange blossom honey with tons of toffee, rich caramel and a bourbon booze in the back. Notes of oak and vanilla in the finish round off the edges for a very rich beer. Judging for the style, this was a complex, interesting, and nicely done barleywine.  ",4,4,4.5,4,4,4.2

71079,hopphead31415,2015-07-28,"   I was celebrating with some friends and found this new variety on tap at the bar. We ordered a pitcher and poured into the standard bar pint glasses. Everyone was drinking away missing all the finer qualities of this beauty, while I was actually taking a moment to consider all of its components and writing them down on my phone to post here on beer advocate. It has a respectable 7.5% ABV and 70 IBUs and boasts the arguably unique component of Guava. Look-With stunning clarity one can see the golden, but deep amber color to this beer. I see copper hues in the light and the head completely vanishes inside a minute. Smell-It has a great malt base which is ripe with hops and the guava smell is just noticeable. Taste-I get a brief grainy caramel based malts with a toasted spiciness. The middle palate quickly picks up on some grassy and citrus hops with a noticeable guava component that manifests itself among the hops. I get tangerine, clementine, and orange peel zest which are clearly from the citrus and grassy hops. It finishes spicy and bitter, but clean and crisp. Mouthfeel-It is a medium-bodied caramel-based malt brew with guava and plenty of hops. Overall-It is excellent and refreshing for any good hop head to enjoy. It is well-balanced and creamy. Enjoy!  ",4,4,4.25,3.75,4,4.08

Nose of resinous and peppery hops, rich caramel, and sugary sweet agave. Flavors are tangy sweet forward, with caramel, grapefruit, and melon, followed by a sugary sweet and floral kick from the agave. The backbone gets the hops character, heavy on the resin and grassy notes. Smooth, dry, and crisp, with a roasted, rustic sweet aftertaste. Clean, dry, crisp finish, with a subtle floral and sugary linger. Good beer.  ",4,3.75,4,4,4,3.94

O'Connor did the style justice and this is a very nicely balanced and flavored IPA. Sweet malty and hoppy in balance, but no bitterness in the finish. At 7.5% its about at the perfect ABV for feel in a standard IPA as well. Enjoyable and recommended.  ",4,4,4.5,4,4.25,4.25

179485,IckyT2012,2015-10-08,   I still haven't been able to get a straight answer on if this is the same as Last Buffalo in the Park (but leaving out the buffalo trace name on the bottle to avoid royalties??). It tastes about like I remember the last buffalo tasting several months ago. Still one of the best stouts I've ever tasted.  ,4.25,5,5,4.5,4.75,4.86
179485,mkultra87,2015-10-07,   This stuff is exceptional. Last Snow is one of my favorite beers so i'm not surprised that I enjoyed this imperial barrel aged version as much as I did. Had several pours of this at the Snowed In release at the brewery and I'm glad I drank them quickly because it did not last very long at all. You could smell the coconut-coffee-syrupiness the second you walked in the door. My only complaint is that i t was so limited... brew more of this!  ,5,5,5,5,5,5
179485,ricoslim,2015-10-07,   Stands up to the hype. Great boozy flavor and aroma comes out of the bourbon barrels. Feel is thicker than Last Snow and the barrel mellows the coconut the perfect amount. Great beer!  ,4.75,5,4.75,5,4.75,4.84

Coconut and coffee are still the primary aromas. Bourbon and oak behind. Taste is sharp bourbon, equally sharp coffee. Bourbon and oak. Really sweet but there’s enough going on that it doesn’t get cloying. Medium heavy. Coffee cuts the sweetness a lot. Really delicious beer.  ",4,5,4.25,4,4.75,4.49

100851,stakem,2013-12-05,"   Draft offering at Zucks. The brew appears a hazy copper color with an off-white cap. Some spotty lace and decent head retention. The aroma is fruity to floral with alcohol and a bit of caramel grains. Somewhat toasty with a solid green yeastiness filling out most of the brew's aroma profile from middle to back. The flavor is sweet and fruity, almost pear or apple skins are present before the onset of caramel and toffee-like maltiness. There is a soft floral alcohol accent and the brew finishes green with a distracting yeastiness across the finish. This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall it has a lot of potential but my overall feel for this is that it was rushed to completion and the yeast never got to clean itself up. That aside, this is a decent brew.  ",3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.34

Taste is quite hoppy, only a little of the apricot that was on the nose, with a dry finish. Not too many clean flavours to describe, well integrated. Mouthfeel is the only let down - crerany and medium bodied byt becomes quite oily by the end. A good find on tap.  ",4,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,3.63

73535,htomsirveaux,2011-09-27,"   Tried on tap at Crown, 27 Sep 2011. Served in a shaker pint glass. Billed as a hoppy American wheat ale. Medium sized creamy light beige head. Minimally carbonated. Clear light brown in color. Aroma is oddly of blueberries, making me wonder if there was some mixup at the bar. Some pine is also present, faintly. The blueberry aroma fades as I drink. A second glass doesnt have any blueberry in it. Starts with a slight bit of yeastiness that quickly changes to a nice bitter hit of hoppiness. Touch of grapefruit pithiness. Yeasty bitter finish and aftertaste. Medium body. Light alcohol. 100 IBUs of Summit is claimed for this beer.  ",,,,,,3.47
243401,digboy,2017-11-15,"   Pours a very cloudy, pale yellow gold color with half finger off-white head. I like the coloring. Aroma has mango orange notes, not too sweet though. Very pleasant. Taste follows the smell. Low malt and medium bitterness make for a clean hop flavor with a mildly bitter finish. Very smooth and creamy feel from the lactose fills out the beer well and offers a nice balance to the crisp flavor. Has a bit of seltzer in the feel as well. This is one of the most enjoyable beers I've had from GC. It is not trying to be over the top with hop flavor - just a clean fresh and slightly sweet experience. Not sure why it is being voted so low - maybe I just got a ""good batch"" of it?  ",4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.34

Juicy citrus and melon with a hint of milk stout on the nose. Bitter creamy weird citrusy tropical fruit flavor. Somewhat harsh bitterness lingers deep into the finish and after. Light buttery diacetyl flavor. Meh. It almost seems like they tried to soften an overly harsh IPA by adding lactose. Drinkable but not world class.  ,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.56

71079,ThisWangsChung,2015-05-13,"   12 oz bottle into a teku. Appearance: Pours a darker copper color. The head is a finger high and off-white in shade. Retention isn't very special, but it has a soft texture and good thickness. Streaks of lacing adhere to the glass. (3.25) Smell: It says the style is English IPA, so I expect fruit esters...and fruit esters I get. Notes of apricot, peach, and marmalade provide a great ballast to the grapefruit-forward hop profile. Agave doesn't dominate the nose by any means, but I definitely get a little bit of the stuff, along with some vanilla cream and caramel from the malts. I really enjoy the nose here: I always like British ale esters paired with some American hops (see also: Jaipur, Thornbridge). (4) Taste: It starts off citrusy from the hops. On the other hand, I'm disappointed to find that the yeast profile here seems neutral rather than estery. Ah well. The middle of the beer is malty, providing cream, caramel, and toffee; it finishes with an herbaceous bite and some agave sweetness. Despite my slight disappointment, this does work nicely. (3.5) Mouthfeel: Just like honey, agave gives the beer some initial sweetness, but a dry finish. Translation: it's sweet, but not oppressive. Along with lively carbonation, this goes down fairly easily. (3.5) Overall: An 85 for this is right on the money - this is very likable, but not quite elite. The agave isn't a gimmick, instead it adds a dimension that aids this IPA above the ranks of averageness. Definitely a worthy example of the style. (3.5) 3.61/5: Not that unique (agave notwithstanding), but rock-solid execution  ",3.25,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.61

71079,MUTINY,2015-04-09,"   This is my first real attempt to review a beer properly on here. Drunk from a very fresh bottle poured into a wine tumbler. A: Stunning golden/orange hues. Head is eggshell white & seems to dissipate quickly. Can't speak to retention & lacing as much due to the glassware being used. S: Lively. Nice balance between grapefruity citrus hoppiness & mellow caramelly malt. Very inviting nose, screams: DRINK ME! T: Again, lively & balanced. Somewhat bitter citrus hits hard first, followed by exactly enough malt to provide a counterpoint on the palate. I'd say the agave is subtle but detectable, not a gimmick, just a refined usage. It provides a sweetish lead-in to the bitter, somewhat lingering finish. All good things here, ABV is masked well & despite the longish dry finish this beer is truly refreshing. M: Near perfect for the flavors here. The carbonation is right where a lively IPA should be, especially with the subtle agave sweetness. The malt could perhaps provide a bit more body here, if only to provide a bit more textural complexity through the finish. But I'm picking nits here. O: I'd had this locally where I used to live & they've just recently started shipping to my current stomping grounds. Nothing has changed with this brew, it is as consistent & enjoyable as ever - I'm a happy guy to be able to pick this one up on the regular.  ",5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.52

Piney and earthy, somewhat dirty, a little hops mixed with grass and dried grains and some sweetness. The taste is simple in it's malt character with hops that are present but not huge. The agave can be tasted (at least I think that's agave...). Smooth, maybe slightly watery, but that might just be that I'm fishing for more hops. The aftertaste isn't the greatest, reminds me a lot of Anchor Steam in the finish... interesting. This isn't a cookie cutter IPA, so thank you! Would drink again.  ",4.25,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.72

Aroma bursts with orange citrus fruit, peach, white wine, and light pine. Sweet caramel malts provide a solid base for the citrus hops to shine. There's a slight spice in the finish, which is bitter and long-lasting. An assertive beer with tons of flavor, but there is restraint and balance. It's so smooth and clean that not much effort is needed to finish the entire pint. Tree House certainly has their hoppy beers dialed in. Thanks, Ian!  ",4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.26

T: The taste starts out with a strong floral hops bitterness that is quickly followed by a strong fruity citrus sweetness. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a good balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet. M: Smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.

I'd take the KBS over this one, probably, but let's be real here: this is the epitome of the style. Smoother than it should be, and reasonably balanced, but the flavor tips over to maple pretty heavily. Still, you get a fair share of chocolate, wood, practically no bitterness, and a decent head but mild carbonation. Rich and succulent, this would be the perfect desert beer after a hefty steak and paired with some chocolate cake or something, or just sipped by itself beside a fire.

Appearance is pretty thick, but not motor oil thick, which is what I look for in a stout. Nose is good, but just missing that pop. Sweet, somewhat roasty, but the maple doesn't pop like I want it too. Almost has a lactose like thing going. Taste is better, maple comes out more but it's not too big, definitely nothing like KBBS. Sweet but not cloying and very smooth. Feel is almost perfect, I'd just prefer it to be a little thicker. But it's almost there and still really great. CBS is really really good, and I generally rate high, but it's not perfect. If you can find it on tap, definitely give it a shot.

47658,brother_rebus,2015-07-17,"   Not the biggest bourbon barrel aged beer fan. Have had KBS a handful of times and thought it was OK. But its cousin CBS is an entirely different beast. Much more smooth in my opinion. More foreword CO2. The vanilla and coffee flavors expose themselves far more to my pallet. I do enjoy this on the colder side, as the vanilla-ish taste isn't overtaken by the ABV and the cold feel is contrasted perfectly with the warmth the alcohol brings to the back of the tongue. Spectacular beer. Really must try to find it in a bottle.  ",5,4,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.59

You get an initial whiff and taste but it fades right off the bat. Very drinkable and Smooth. Not a lot of bite back. Had a draft. Could drink several. Hides the ABV well. Solid but a little disappointing as it was previously hyped to me.  ",,,,,,3.5

71079,GreesyFizeek,2014-06-28,"   Extra in a trade with themeadhatter. Thanks man! Pours a copper orange, with a one inch head, and a little bit of lacing. Smells like toasted malts, sweet grain, and piney hops. The taste is similar. I don't know how fresh this is, but the hops don't shine as brightly as I would've thought. Some pine and resin, lots of toasted malt flavor, a little bit of caramel, with some slight citrus. Don't really taste the agave nectar, but it is a bit sweet, so that might be part of it. Medium bodied, crisp, but moderately creamy mouthfeel near the end. Low carbonation. Not too bad, but doesn't exactly seem like a brown ale, almost like a hoppy brown.  ",4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.67

Over ripe citrus. Redolent of hops. Floral w/ light bitterness. Citrus. Rather sweet malt, Faint bitterness in the end. Light to moderate in body, but still warming. Very flavorful and citric.

71079,prototypic,2013-06-23,"   El Guapo is an interesting collision of copper and orange. When held to light, it looks more orange. It’s very clear. No haze. An off-white head sits on top and rises to about a finger or so in height. It recedes rather quickly, leaving a moderate coat of sticky lace clinging to the glass. Looks alright. I’m not crazy about the smell. It features a very strong sweet caramel scent up front. Whether it’s English or an American IPA, that doesn’t work so well. It just masks a lot of the other good stuff. It does have a citric, fruity scent to it. It smells sweet. That must be the agave. It features some light citric hop scents of grapefruit and orange. They really fight for space in the wealth of caramel malt though. Alcohol is a little noticeable, but isn’t overwhelming. All in all, it’s not bad. Not very good either. Average it is. The flavor is a bit above average. Not very good. The caramel malt base is just too much. It’s very sweet and overwhelms the flavor profile. There are some citric, fruity flavors. Grapefruit and orange hop flavors are present. It’s not exactly bitter. The malt base is too much of an equalizer. There’s an interesting flavor to it that’s a little reminiscent of honey. I suspect that’s the agave. Alcohol is there, but doesn’t come through too strong. It’s not warm or hot. Finishes with a sweet caramel taste and just a hint of fruity notes. Eh. Just okay. The body is about medium. Carbonation is rather light and soft. It has a pretty good mouthfeel. Given the wealth of caramel malt, that’s not a huge shock. El Guapo is just an okay beer. The agave flavor is interesting, but does little to compete with the overly strong caramel malt presence. Toning that down would go a long way to improving this one. It’s worth a try. Stick with a single bottle, if possible.  ",3.5,3,3.25,3.75,3.25,3.26

64992,LittleCreature,2011-09-30,"   Appearance - 4.5 Pours a big fluffy white head over a clear body of deepest gold. Good head retention and solid lacing. Smell - 4.0 Intense pilsner malt sweetness reminds of shortbread and is very nice indeed. Backed up by yeasty notes of sweet pear and candy cane, low to no hop aroma. Taste - 4.0 Very little upfront sweetness, honeyed malt backbone, apricot and lightly herbal hops in the finish with moderate bitterness. Bone dry in the finish, doesn't hide its alcohol as well as the best Belgians. Mouthfeel - 3.5 Moderate to lively carbonation, very crisp and dry, light body. Overall - 4.0 This is a very interesting beer, proclaimed to be a hybrid influened by Saisons, Blond Ales and Tripels. I agree with this - it's not funky enough to be a Saison, too big to be a Blond and too dry to be a Tripel. Ultimately the style this comes closest to is exactly what it is posted as here: Belgian Strong Pale Ale, or as the BJCP would have it, Belgian Golden Strong Ale. Overall it comes across as a smaller, slightly too bitter version of Duvel. Improves with increasing degrees, so don't drink it straight out of the fridge!  ",4.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.98
64992,Stew41,2011-07-29,"   Commercial description reads accurately. Has that Belgian sweet yeasty character, at least early, but the hop impact is very defining and well done. Pommel-like. The hop impact does stop the fruit in its tracks and leaves you with the sense that the beer just stumbles at the last mile. But I’m being unfair because this beer is achieving what it sets out to achieve.  ",3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.52
64992,Knapp85,2011-05-28,"   Part of a trade with MrKennedy, this is my first Murray's brew and it looks quite impressive. The pour is a hazy golden color with a healthy amount of white head on top. The lacing a pretty good as well. The smell is really nice, it's a little spicy, a little floral, slightly sweet. Really had the elements of each Belgian style they weregoing for. The taste is very good, a lot like a the aroma is hits on just about every level. The mouthfeel is enjoyable also, it's kinda creamy and smooth. Overall I enjoyed a lot. It was really impressive and very cool idea from the Murray's!  ",4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.38
64992,juju7,2011-05-15,"   After reading the blurb on the back of the bottle and then drinking the beer, I'd say they achieved exactly what they set out to do. A very good hybrid Belgian style beer that seems to take the best bits from a couple of styles and frankensteins them seamlessly. The drinkablity of a saison with the depth and warmth of a tripel and the character of both. Extremely easy to drink despite the ABV. Really enjoyed this one.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4
64992,spicelab,2011-04-26,"   Mostly clear honey with a boisterous white head that abates relatively quickly but leaves plenty of lacing. Mmmmm spicy belgian yeast. Oodles of fruity esters - banana, musk and sweet candy are prevented from becoming too sickly by a moderate punch of fresh cut grass. Also get walnuts, hazelnuts and a duller grainy note with plenty of doughy malts rounding it out. Truckloads of fruity esters again: peach, pear and sweet melons. What really makes it fun are the confectionery flavours that take me back 25 years - toffee apple bars and watermelon bubblegum. Grassy funk, peppery spice and floral notes like orange blossom keep things in check. I hesitate to give this a 4.5 but I'm from a family of diehard sweet-tooths. Dryish, moderately bitter finish. Not much layering or bedding down of flavours. Carbonation maybe a tad high. Overall a terrifically fun beer. Straddles a number of styles pretty successfully. Might offend the beard strokers but stuff 'em.  ",4,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.15
64992,laituegonflable,2011-04-15,"   Pours a dull orange colour with fine haze throughout, rendering it largely opaque. Fine trails of bead all around the edges. Head is very pleasing - dense, a shade darker than white, retaining very nicely with some beautiful sticky lace. Looks a cracker. Smells nicely fruity. Faint touch of something that might have been hops with a citric tang and some piney wood. Underlying fragrance of banana, peach and nectarine. Beautiful combination of lovely subtle esters, a touch of grassy funk in there, just nicely tangy, sweet and appealing. Taste is an interesting one. Starts quite tangy with all those stone fruit notes hitting the palate - peach mostly, with banana and apricot as well. Develops a strong funky character midway with a domineering medicinal flavour; really quite bitter that kind of peaks late-mid where it gets a slight bitter rind note, then trails off for the finish. The back-palate is unfortunately lacking; just a lingering phenolic aftertaste that feels empty. Overall quite tasty, I just want it to finish stronger. Nicely full body with a slight warmth from the alcomohol. Slight tingle, pretty decent feel. Yeah, enjoying this quite a lot. It's an interesting twist on Belgian flavours. Would like the sweet front to last a bit longer and maybe some more funk on the back, but it's a pleasant drop nonetheless.  ",4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.95

64992,Macca,2011-03-08,"   This pours a cloudy rich orange colour with a minimal, but solid, white head. Spicy yeastiness dominates the nose.

64992,CrazyDavros,2011-03-06,"   Pours amber with a large, lasting, creamy white head and lovely lacing. Nose is very fruity, lots of passionfruit, apples and pears. Very sweet smelling. Next some doughy yeast shows through alongside soft spicy phenols. Very nice! Similarly light flavours. And quite sweet (indicative of the use of candi sugar?). Lots of sweet malt, not so much in the way of fruit. Alcohol and high carbonation dries out the finish somewhat. I'm not sure if it's due to high alpha bittering hops or the alcohol but the finish does feel quite sharp, almost metallic. Mind you, this fades as it warms up.  ",5,4,4,3,4,3.96
64992,dgilks,2011-02-02,"   Slightly hazy golden colour with a moderately small white head. Fair head retention. Mild spicy, fruity aroma with clear yeast presence.

Citrussy, tropical hops. Mild bitterness. Medium body with moderate to crisp carbonation. A well crafted and interesting ale.

64992,lacqueredmouse,2011-01-03,"   Tried on tap at the brewery 2nd of Jan 2011. I heard a rumour this wasn't even making its way to the Local Taphouses; if so I'm pleased I got a chance to sample it. Pours a clear golden yellow colour, with minimal head, although the lady who served it seemed very keen to fill my glass to the top rather than promoting any head. Lacing is fine, thick and consistent. Very slow streams of carbonation creep through the body. Not bad. Nose is quite light, with phenolic characters dominant. A bit of spice and a light boozy character. As it warms some sweeter notes of organic honey come through. Pleasant enough, but pretty light. Taste is a bit more boozy, and rather spicy with phenols. Very light in the body. It's clean, but the lightness turns into thinness on the back. No harshness at least. There's a little bit of that round Belgian sweetness - a bit sharp at times, as it warms it gets some lightly sour-bitter astringent fruit characters as well. It's very mild, stylistically, though. Eh, has Shawn lost some of his mojo recently? I haven't been hugely enamoured of either of his last two seasonals. You can see what he's doing here, but it's nothing out of the ordinary, or anything to excite the Murray's fans. It's very drinkable for a 7.5% ABV beer, but that's it's best attribute - and the lack of really bold flavours doesn't really excite me enough to want to drink a lot of it. Decent, but bland.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

114671,StonedTrippin,2015-03-02,"   awesome brew, not sure i would call it a quad, as its not nearly big and rich and sweet enough, and if there is a belgian yeast strain in here, its awfully mild. it is delicious though, sort of reminds me a less rustic and complex madragore from BFM, although i would take that one over this one in a second. it has a rich dark mahogany color, short lived quarter inch of tan crema on top. it smells like tasted grain, short of roasted barley, no bitterness at all, but its not sweet either, so id like to know more about the grain bill. its really well done. it tastes like a shorter boil too, things arent all caramelized here, although they seem to be moving in that direction. what i taste the most of is dark fruit, dried bing cherries, prunes, even figs, but the beer isnt fruity in the traditional sense of belgian yeast, which is why i have to assume it was fermented pretty cool for a belgian type, and it really works for the feel of this beer, which is dry but fluffy, almost chalky in its residual feel, but somehow really thick and rich still. its confusing but its delicious. off color has impressed me, i wish more of their beer made it out to colorado. cool that its a three floyds collaboration too, we never see their beer!  ",4,3.75,3.75,4,4,3.84

114671,jerefreakinmiah,2014-07-02,"   So this is nowhere near being a quad. Somebody misnamed this bad boy. It's more in line with a well-crafted stout. If you've had the great fortune of having a Southern Star Buried Hatchet Stout, then you know what this beer is about. No Belgian yeast, candy sugar, or carbonation that you'd associate with a quad is present. Just a yummy, toasted malt that makes me think of autumn days and hazelnut chocolate. Nowhere near being true to the style, but all the same a beautiful beer. Quad? What were you guys thinking??? Stout? Now we're talking!  ",4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.25,4.45

114671,cosmicevan,2014-06-08,"   Picked up a growler of this less than an hour ago, enjoyed from a FFF teku. Brew pours a deep chestnut brown that settles in the glass as black. The thin grey head doesn't hang out long. Nose is a really nice nutty plum. Brown sugar and lots of toasted malt. Taste is big roasted malt followed by a nice dark fruit and then washed over with nuts and toasted malt. Oaty. Definitively has a FFF feel to the flavor... Mouth is really nice and even. Medium to full bodied. Doesn't feel creamy like a quad by any means...but easy drinking. Overall I dug this beer. For a quad, not so much...but as a beer, very tasty. Apparently this is a half Belgian strong quad? Motive point is a bit high, but extremely happy to be able to find something like this locally.  ",3.25,3.75,4,4,4,3.9

Taste is pretty close to the smell. Some molasses and dark caramel sweet come through. The roasted malt is first and is followed by a yeasty note. A little breadyness comes through. Mouth feel is pretty middle of the road. Moderate body and has some decent carbonation. Flows pretty easily over the tongue. Overall, a good solid beer. Mix of styles perhaps. Worth a second try.  ",3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.67

125646,cbutova,2015-11-29,"   11/25/15 dated can. Finally having this one again after over a year. A- Tallboy to a tall, narrow chalice with an extremely hop hazed medium yellow body and a head rising past two fingers. The crown's texture is thick and creamy and it eventually falls to a pillow in the middle and large ring; good retention. S- Bright and all hops in the forefront with juiciness in the form of both citrus and tropical/stone fruits. Things that come to mind are: tangerines, oranges, grapefruit, pineapple, cantaloupe, mango, tropical bubble gum and floral dank tones. Strength-wise somewhere in the middle of what I expect from Tree House, doesn't burst out quite as much as others. T- What strength/saturation was missing the smell is instantly found here as it explodes onto the palate like a mixed nectar of citrus and tropical fruit juices. Reiteration of things found in the nose but in a somewhat altered order melon, peach and mango up front followed by tangerine, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, dank herbs and floral notes. Hints of sweetness and cracker grains while the microbes are kept silent. MF- Medium-heavy overall body with a texture right down the line between frothy and creamy. The bubbles come down at a moderately high level promoting some seriously zesty and juicy flavors. Clean bitter finish. A very smooth and easy drinking 8%+ IPA. Plenty of juicy flavors with an emphasis on both citrus and tropical tones. Another supercharged, pungent hop nectar effort out of Monson.  ",4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.35

125646,Goblinmunkey7,2015-11-28,"   Appearance: Hazy peachy gold. Head is bright-white and super creamy. Sheets and big sticky notches of lacing coat the glass . Moderate carbonation on the pour. Smell: Super juicy. Orange, nectarine, peach, and some grapefruit. It's super tropical with a nice citrus edge. Orange and grapefruit in abundance under the big tropical push. A slight push of dank earth coupled with a soft spiciness. Malts are relatively light with just a touch of caramelized sweetness. Some biscuit dough and a touch of pale malt. Some weed and a solid dirty pine in the back. Peach flesh, grapefruit rind, and a touch of mint leaf. Slightly woody. Taste: Follows the nose to a T. Super juicy and tropical with a bunch of orange and grapefruit. Successive sips add a touch of dirty pine and a mild woodiness. Solid hop spiciness coupled with peach, nectarine, and mango. A touch of fresh mint leaf. Malts are relatively light with some pale malt sweetness, a touch of biscuit dough, and a touch of caramelized sweetness. More mango creeps out as it warms. Loaded with orange juice and flesh. A touch of grapefruit and orange zest. Juiciness drops a touch as it warms. Dank and spicy with a soft floral edge. Moderately bitter. Some hop oil. Mouthfeel: Creamy medium body with a moderate carbonation. Slightly dry on the finish with a slick initial sip and follow through. Smooth. Overall: Tropical weed juice. This is juicy weed in a tropical fruit bowl. A bit messy overall, but everyone should drink this as often as possible.  ",4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.4

It's wildly hoppy without actually going over the top. I suppose it could be a bit cleaner overall, but here, the chaos really works. I genuinely like this more than Green. Once again, I find myself impressed. Update (multiple re-tastings) - I pretty much up my score every time I have this. I adore it.  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.68

125646,invertalon,2015-11-25,"   I think I may have found a favorite new DIPA. Poured from a can into a glass… Appearance was cloudy and orange in color. Aroma was intense citrus/orange, juicy and delicious. The taste was vivid orange and other citrus fruit. Bitterness was well balanced with the perceived sweetness from the beer. Medium body. The 8% ABV is basically undetectable. I was blown away by this beer… Just amazing.  ",4.5,5,5,4.75,5,4.95

71079,teromous,2013-06-18,"   A: Very bright transparency. The body is a medium shade of amber and dark orange. The head is slightly off-white and very thin. Despite the lack of head, there is good lacing. S: Not much scent to the beer. There is a faint hint of citrus hop aroma. T: There is a nice bread crust flavor to the beer. This is followed by an earthy woody flavor and a bit of grapefruit that is very light. I'm not sure if the ""Agave IPA"" thing is more of a gimmick, but it doesn't make any noticeable flavor contribution. It's missing some malt caramel flavor and sweetness that you'd find in an English style IPA, but the hop flavor is good. M: The mouthfeel is very good, with the exception that the beer feels under-carbonated. I wouldn't say that the carbonation lessens the experience of drinking, but it's worth mentioning. The beer is very easy to drink, leaves a slightly bitter presence in the mouth like after eating a slice of multi-grain bread which slows you down just slightly. It's a good drinking experience. O: Overall I wasn't really sure what part the agave had to play in this beer. I felt that it was a pretty good IPA but there were a few points that set me off balance. It's gets the traditional ""wouldn't buy again but would drink again"" response.  ",3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.38
71079,Merkinstandard,2013-06-12,"   What I like is that it is unique. It has a hint of tequila, thanks to the agave, but not so much that you'll be taken back to those alcohol-poisoned college nights at Baja Bean. The problem for me is that I read the bottle first. It is not as in-your-face with aroma and flavor as the brewery describes. I am glad that they didn't hide behind overpowering hop bitterness. The finish could be stronger, but the lingering sugars are nice and refreshing. Unlike tequila, it gets better as it warms.  ",3.5,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.57

152625,Slatetank,2015-02-03,"   I appreciated tenderbranson69 for sharing this with me, growler into a pils glass repeated a couple times. The color is slight golden shade with pale appearance and quickly vanishing white head with visible carbonation in solution and no retetnion or lace. The smell is mildly lactic/lemony with a mild wheat sweetness and slightly tangy sour aspect. The feel is gently sweet with light body and practically no bitterness with slight spice and mostly dry finish with almost no carbonation. The taste makes up for the appearance and feel with good malt up front with slight wheaty sweetness with a low salt flavor if any but subtle tangy taste as it finishes with a mild lemony quality. Overall it is hard to make a small beer taste refreshing and enjoyable as Tired hands has done with this gose -mild wheat not very salty and good session strength without any off flavor or funk to speak of-try it.  ",3.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.84

71079,Ysgard,2013-05-21,"   EDIT: I've run into a few old bottles. They age into a nice barleywine, but very sweet. I can see where folks might be getting old bottles. For some reason the distributor was charging more for a local 6er than most national labels. Caused these to sit past their prime. Best on tap still, but a fresh bottle is quite good. One of my personal favorites from a local brewery. A: Clear and golden, light white head that laces but doesn't tend to get overly foamy. S: Citrus, nectar, tropical fruit. Bright is this IPAs stock in trade. Almost like a baby Hopslam. T: Delicious. Malt sweetness isn't really present, instead theres a nectar-like sensation, with solid hop finish, and tropical and citrus flavors dancing around the middle with the nectar flavors. The Agave really plays well with the hops in this guy. It's change a bit, as I understand that some of the american hops were in short supply last year, but it seems they have it nailed back down. M: Light, sometimes almost too light to support. Not a detractor at all, but not noteworthy. I feel like I want to get a touch of toasty/crackery malts to tie back the agave. O: I love this beer when its on, and even when it was adjusting to market hops availability, it was still above average by quite a bit. I love this like my first taste of hopslam, but I can get this super fresh all year round.  ",4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.27

47658,VikingBeer,2015-06-08,"   Typical imperial stout appearance: black as oil, with a persistent lacy head and a few faint bubbles of carbonation. Pretty, but plenty of stouts look better than they taste. This, however, is not one of them. The aromas are dominated by a sugary, maple-syrup scent, closely followed by coffee, whiskey, oak, and hints of fruit, with the barest whiff of booze. On the tongue, the beer presents a nicely rich mouthfeel, with just enough carbonation to keep things deliciously drinkable. Flavors roll in with a big hit of sweet coffee and maple syrup up front, closely followed by a wave of whiskey. Heady flavors of buckwheat, bittersweet chocolate, oak, pecans snd hazelnuts and more whiskey roll through, with the sometimes slightly overwhelmingly sweet maple syrup and coffee always reappearing. More subtle flavors appear on the back end of the palate, with blueberries, dried fruit, and even a slight hint of mint-tea and herbal hop notes. On the back of the tongue, loads of spices make an appearance, including cinnamon nutmeg and cloves. Finish is, surprisingly, medium-dry, making up somewhat for the assertive sweetness throughout.  ",4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.64

302179,jlindros,2017-11-08,"   This looks like a fun beer, from what also looks like it could be a great brewery. Pours a huge fizzy bubbly 2+ finger head that fades at a med pace, a bit of sticky lacing, a mostly clear slight chill hazed and very slight sediment laden bright almost neon yellow color. Nose nice toasted grainy malt, raw mashed toasted almost bread dough like malt, cereal grain, etc, then some yeast characters, mild esters, fruity notes, a touch of lemon, lemon like cake batter perhaps, perhaps a touch of peppery phenols in the background, a mild minerality as well, and some mild grassy hops. taste brings much stronger flavors starting with grassy herbal hops, a bit of spicy almost chewy bite with a fair to stronger bitterness, back into grainy doughy malt, crackery toasted cracked wheat bread dough, a lot of different descriptors to really just say cereal grainy malt. Mild perfumey peppery phenols in the background, and some fruity esters just hint that they are there as they seem to be mostly drowned out by the malts and hops, again a tinge of lemon cake batter, and faint minerality. Finish is drier, a fair spicy grass hop coming though, more grainy cereal malt also lingering. Mouth is med bod, effervescent carbonation. Overall a nice solid Belgian pale, almost a bit too aggressive in the hops but it plays out well, malts were great, yeast was nice but I wish was also a bit more proliferant, otherwise a well done beer.  ",4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25

Smells cocoa nib, fine coffee vanilla, and butterscotch. Mild hop grassiness. Tastes like the rich milk chocolate filling you find in the middle of a quality dark chocolate. Strong hazelnut, gentle coffee and vanilla with a finish that's drying and of high-end hot cocoa powder. Acidic finish with strong fine drying carbonation. Mild esters and clean hop bittter. Not much beer character, but interesting use of chocolate.  ",,,,,,3.53

78043,macrosmatic,2014-10-03,"   Reviewed from notes. Poured from 750 mL bottle into a Russian River pint glass. A: Pours a dark amber, very hazy, with a 1 1/2-finger white fluffy head with good retention. Average visible carbonation. Surprisingly dark for an ""IPA"". S: When first smelled after pouring, there's caramel sweetness, resin hops, some booze heat, bready malts - it smelled nearly like an American barleywine. Through the drink however, the impression of the high alcohol and heavy malt presence dissipated somewhat. T: Orange citrus fruit and sticky resin, light cracker malt (more delicate than the aroma suggested), a touch of caramel malt. The back end is citrus-forward, reminiscent of the bright tangerine of an orange drink from camp. Lightly bitter in the hang. M: Minimal alcohol presence, especially compared to the initial aroma. Lighter body than the appearance suggested. Carbonation sensation fairly low. O: This had a weird dichotomy between the appearance and initial aroma impressions versus the flavors found while drinking. I drank a Lagunitas Daytime directly before this, and it's possible there was an effect on my palate. Overall, this was enjoyable, but the orange juice flavor I could have done without. I'm curious as to whether another bottle would have the same experience, but I didn't like it near enough to justify purchasing another bottle to find out.  ",3,3.25,3.75,4,3.75,3.61

Taste follows nose, malty with toasted notes and wood. Well condimented and with hints of orange peel. Dry aftertaste with presence of burnt wood. Full body with good carbonation and tiny bubbles.

It poured with a quarter finger high beige head that died down, leaving a collar around the edge of the glass. S: Light to moderate aromas of dark and roasted malts are present in the nose. T: The taste shares some similarities with the smell, but is somewhat more complex with notes of Belgian yeast and slight hints of dark fruits. There also hints of a strange taste that I can't put my finger on. M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.

78043,chickenflea,2014-03-16,"   Bottle purchase in Cedar Rapids. Pours a golden orange. Cloudy with a soft effervescence. Massive white foamy head that open up slowly. Excellent aroma. Citrusy hops. The mango and passionfruit come through a little although the hops are features. The fruit gives the aroma a clean dimension. Love it. The taste is mild by American Pale Ale standards. Somewhat like a hoppy session saison. Passionfruit mutes the malt. Finish is somewhat dry. Soft almost watery mouthfeel. This is not a problem unless you really want to bracket this beer with the pale ales. It seems to me more like a hybrid, and so I tend to be more forgiving. No hint of alcohol in taste or aroma although we are getting into higher values. So what's not to like about this beer? Not much, unless you were expecting something else.  ",4.5,4,4.25,3.75,4.5,4.21

Fun to watch. Aroma of mixed tropical fruit, mostly mango and citrus hops. Flavor is mango, passionfruit, orange with light bready malt, finishes with grapefruit rind and light grassy hops. Light bodied, but nice active carbonation. An interesting experiment of taking the tropical fruit flavors from hops to the limit by using fruit juice. Very refreshing, but maybe a bit too much of a good thing with the added mango. I enjoyed this, but probably will not revisit.  ",4,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.85

71079,JayQue,2012-05-25,"   A pretty decent IPA!!! I had this one at the Green Parrot in Va Beach to accompany a good soft shell crab dinner. Much better than their Black Dismal IPA. Pours a nice copper color with a small white head, head retention is good and there are thick rings of lacing on the glass. The head might have been even better but the beer was served in the usual chilled pint glass. Aroma of piney and citrus hops is more robust than many IPAs. A good hoppy smell. Tastes good as well. This is a balanced IPA. A nice citrus hops blast up front which is then softened by mild caramel malt. The hops clearly come out ahead but the malty presence keeps this from being a real hophead delight. Mouthfeel is crisp and rich enough. If I was going back to the Parrot, I would order this again. Tastes good, goes well with food.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

T: The grains and caramel swing in first and dominate. A weak herbal hop note pushes its way to the front and then gives in to more grain. The malts really come out and toasted multi-grain bread is overwhelming. There is a slight bitter note as it ends. M: Medium and fizzy. Nothing overwhelming. O: The grain and bread notes really dominate. The hops were subtle and delicate. Worth a try if you like English IPA's.

71079,Zraly,2011-11-06,"   Had this on tap at Gordon Biersch, one of the guest taps. Poured into a Nonic pint glass. Decent copper color with minimal head. Decent lacing. The hops were not evident up front; the faintest smell of them lingered with the malty note that predominated the flavor. The hop note that did develop was earthy and mild with a touch of citrus toward the finish. For style, I thought there was a bit too much booze in the finish -- I'd prefer a dry, hoppy note to end each sip. I think there is potential but overall it seems a bit off-balance. A touch more hops will bring out the better nature of this ale's angel. 7/11/2013 Had at brewery, seems fresher and cleaner.changed ratings a bit.  ",3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.18
71079,clayrock81,2011-08-01,"   Had on tap at Tortilla West and was a nice pre-dinner beer. Poured a golden hue w/ huge head and lace on top of a mild, bready and light hoppy aroma. Beer is more of the same as it is smooth and light but a little too much so. The hops and malts aren't too noticeable or particular so while I won't say bland they are rather pedestrian. Finishes easy and crisp; an alright beer at best...don't know if I'd recommend it or not.  ",4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.58
71079,gatorguy,2011-07-16,"   Another IPA I tried at Brewfest. Pours a nice red copper color with a fingers worth of frothy white head that leaves some lacing. Smell is kind of weak, but is of spicy hops and slightly of lemon. Taste largely follows the smell, rather hoppy, with some lemon. Mouthfeel is ok, middle of the road here. Not a bad IPA overall, but not one I would find myself seeking out.  ",3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.33

258290,GreesyFizeek,2017-10-27,"   This one pours a very dark black, sticks to the glass, with a small head and not much lacing. When this warms up a bit, this becomes a delightful coconut bomb, with tons of sweet chocolate syrup, and a hint of roast. This is much better than the other Horns variants I've had (Cinnastru and French Vanilla), as the coconut seems well integrated into the stout, and doesn't absolutely ruin the body into an oil slick nightmare. This is pure pastry stout, with gobs of sweet candied coconut, and the huge fudgy character of the base stout. It's definitely sweet, but there's streaks of roasty bitterness across the palate that keep it from being truly cloying. This is surprisingly drinkable, with a lower and soft level of carbonation, and thick/syrupy body. This is a really nice accomplishment. Veil does stouts and sours way, way better than they do IPAs, IMHO.  ",4.25,4.75,4.5,4,4.5,4.5

200774,John_M,2015-12-14,"   On tap at Arch Bridge Taphouse the other day. The beer pours an orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose, this smells pretty impressive, as I get considerable dank earth, pine, light citrus and tropical fruit. Alas, that was to be as good as things would get. On the palate, this beer really comes across as something of a hot mess. While there's plenty of hoppy bitterness in this triple IPA, the alcohol and malt struck me as way too prominent, and the beer comes across as out of balance (yes, I know this is a IIIPA, but even so, it was a chore trying to drink this beast). The finish is hot and boozy, and frankly, I was unable to finish even the small taster glass I got of this. Talked to the bartender about this beer, noting that this beer simply did not seem to compare well with the better IIIPA's on the market (younger, notorious, etc.). Those beers seem to carry the high alcohol much better than this beer, and I think that's the biggest problem with the Head Crusher. Granted, the Fat Head IPA/DIPA style is not my favorite, but even so, I've still been able to appreciate and enjoy other IPA's/DIPA's I've had from this brewery. Not this one.  ",4,4.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.75

Brewer notes are right on: "". . . .balanced with rich English malts. Aromas of pine and tropical fruit and followed by flavors of pineapple, papaya, pine and the icky sticky!"" Pretty much says it all and I agree. Well worth a drink!  ",4,4,4,4,4,4
282656,zshaft,2017-08-20,   Poured from a crowler. Nice soapy head with burnt orange color. Can't see through this haze but the penetrating light makes the edges of the brew glow. Nice. Nose is some malt with pine and floral notes. Im getting some melon notes as well. Mouthfeel is nice and full. Front end is earthy with some sweetness that seems to give way to floral and light spruce and honey with some pine. This is pretty good but not my favorite flavor profile for an ipa. There seems to be a lot of intermingling flavors that are quite interesting and the flavor travels throughout the sip. Dry clean finish is nice. Well done but not my fav. Some people im sure will love this. For me. To much earthy stuff going on.  ,,,,,,3.73

115572,UCLABrewN84,2014-03-13,"   On tap at Lucky Baldwins in Pasadena, CA. Pours a murky honey orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, berry, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with berry and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a tasty hop presence, but a somewhat assertive bitterness.  ",,,,,,3.65

61717,drpimento,2010-09-08,"   Shoot, just when you think you found a winner - Poured with small to medium sized, cream colored head that mostly fades quickly and a little lace. Color is a clear polished brass. Aroma is sweet malt and a little hop. Flavor, except for one massive exception, is not like the usual Euro strong lager: enough hops & carbonation to balance the sweetness. The exception is in my face metallic flavor. Totally dominates all else. Body is decent and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and therefore a dumper.  ",,,,,,2.85
110358,artoolemomo,2014-01-12,"   Appearance- Received with over two fingers' worth of head and seems to have very good retention. The head is an off-white/creamy light beige while the body is a dark amber which appears a medium amber when held up to the light. Lacing is pretty much just sheeting. Nose- At the moment, very light citrus (mostly orange) but not much else. Citrus grows more and more and is very inviting but I wish there was more complexity. Taste- Definitely reflects the nose in huge way. I can definitely tell there are Northwest hops. Lots of orange, some orange peel, and little bit of grapefruit. Slight bitterness from mild pine and resin. Really nice beer but the American hops make it a little different from the altbiers I've had before. I'm not complaining as I'm enjoying this beer so far. Some bread and grain but this is mostly dominated by the orange note (and this is not a bad thing). Some peach as well while some of the malts come through more and more. Some stronger bread and grain followed by some roasted malts that even tend toward coffee. It sounds like it would conflict with the citrus but it works well. It's very mild and has an earthiness to it that really works with the orange and peach. Touches of honey. I'm fairly surprised by this beer- many times HUB's beers are just competent without much complexity. This is a fairly complex for style andis also a good, solid beer. Nothing dominates the palate and the balance and integration are really good. Not quite really good but it flirts with being really good. Mouthfeel- Almost medium bodied with very light carbonation and a fairly smooth texture. Somewhat of a dry finish. Really bolsters an already sublime flavor profile. Drinkability- It's pretty much like candy... that gets you drunk. Very sessionable and very accessible. Five dollars a pint seems very reasonable and I would pay it again. Overall- Good, solid beer that seems to deviate from the style a bit but to good ends. Definitely worth a try and I would buy this again.  ",,,,,,3.84

168682,doktorhops,2015-04-17,"   We meet again Cricketers Arms. Last time it was your Lager which I remarked at the time was as “drinkable as a glass of cold water in Antarctica”, granted that was a while back and I was a bit more scathing in my reviews and had wittier banter (probably from all the Witbiers I used to drink) in any case my reviews have softened so perhaps you stand a chance of not being burned like a school fete sausage in the seventh circle of hell... wait that was fairly witty, sorry Cricketers Arms *cracks knuckles*. Poured from a 330ml bottle into a nonic pint. A: Caramel-tinged hazy ochre body with a pockmarked half centimetre cream coloured head. Looks aiight then, like the caramel tinge in the body, makes me think of caramel and the acquisition of said caramel. 7/10. S: Floral and citric hop notes with toffee and biscuit notes. Certainly well within the bounds of a decent English IPA without being exhilarating in the slightest (and how English is that of a brew?). Could be a bit light in hop flavour judging by the aroma. I hope not. 7/10. T: Sweet and malty upfront with those toffee/biscuit characters, then the hop notes come in and go “don’t forget we’re here!” with a muted floral/citric bitterness towards the end. At this point you’re thinking “not bad”, then comes the aftertaste which is oddly chemical, funky with a touch of astringency that feels out of place. Also even for an English IPA there isn’t enough hops balancing out the malt, which if this was a Belgian Tripel - not a problem in the slightest, but because of the aftertaste... well, not good. 4/10. M: Mid to light bodied, lighter and more watery than it should be, with a slightly gassy carbonation (Aussie brewers strike again with the CO2). 5/10. D: I think Dr. Frankenstein would be impressed with the mishmash nature of this brew: An elbow from here, a toenail from there, bingo - Frankenbeer’s monster. I on the other hand am not rapt with having my tastebuds taken for a ride on some bizarre roller-coaster... also gassy beers? Go away 1980’s, 90’s and early 2000 - I don’t need you anymore - I’ve got my power laces, hoverboards and tasty small-batch beers to keep me sated. 5/10.

78043,mfnmbvp,2013-11-12,"   750 ml bottle, with no apparent bottled on date present. 8941211 printed on the bottle cap. I found this Mikkeller oddity at the local beer store. Intriguing bottle art, with what appears to be the Death's Head moth on the label, named after a band and album that I'm not familiar with. Expectations are moderately high. Poured into an over-sized wine glass. A - Pours a nice thin bright burnt orange colored body with about three fingers of fluffy soapy khaki foam for a head. Very nice head retention for such a high abv beer. A bit lighter in color than you would expect from an 8.00% abv IPA, but it looks pretty nice. Hardly any lacing, but some thin strands. S - Smell is of grapefruit, pine, citrus, some old musty herbal hop presence, some peppery rye, with just a slight bit of grain / bready malt in there. T - Tart lemon zest, sour green apples, grapefruit, pine, pineapple, orange rind; mildly tropical tasting in the end.. A very nice hop profile going on here. I am really enjoying this one. Mild earthiness, faint rye, and a mild dose of that classic Mikkeller yeast presence that I've come to know and love. The citric lemon / lime juices become even more pronounced as the beer sits, lovely. M - Feel is crisp and citric, with mild fruity hop bitterness lingering on the palate. Semi-tart and dry. Medium bodied with ideal carbonation. Overall, another very nice IPA from Mikkeller. I have come to really enjoy his hoppy offerings, and this beer is no exception. Recommended for sure, I would love to see Mikkeller expand packaging to six packs of something, and this would be an ideal candidate, in my opinion.

78043,wl0307,2013-08-01,"   Coming in a 330ml slim brown bottle, BB 15/02/2015, served gently chilled in a straight imperial pint glass. Notes: the back label specifies that oat, mango and passion fruit are used in this brew in addition to one’s usual suspects. A: pours a murky, dark amber to light copper colour, coming with a slowly dissipating off-white foamy head and very restrained carbonation. S: tropical fruits (guava and dried mango) and sweetened semi-toasted tea join force to deliver a fruity and subtly malty aroma, added with a real, sharper tinge of passion fruit (from the real fruit instead of hops?!); given a good swirl, the rather deep dirty-cloth-like pale malts sink in, along with intensive earthy and sprigy hoppiness as well as even thicker fruitiness as of passion fruits and mango juice extract. All in all, the aroma seems to accommodate the lively exotic fruity aroma from hops and the deeper characters from the real juice extract (I guess). T: rather dry, earthy, sharply savoury- and acidic-bitter, and leather-ish yeasty upfront, coming with very restrained contributions from malts and fruity hop flavours really, as if the yeasts have consumed everything in addition to sugars in the wort; the rather chewy, bitter-herbal hop bitterness and old-leather-ish and intensifyingly dry yeastiness prevail in the aftertaste, where old citrus-peel-ish bitterness presents in the most unexpected manner, in that the stinky side comes slightly more than necessary. To my surprise, mangos and passion fruits do not seem to leave a deep-enough mark following the fermentations, not even in the form of aroma. Instead, the super lengthy and deepening hop bitterness is tuned at such a high level, that the palate is rendered so… dry as if a cup of Chinese herbal medicine has been offered in place of a pint of IPA. M&O: lightly effervescent on the mouthfeel, this is a medium-minus bodied, highly-attenuated, yet overly yeasty-tart/acidic and highly unbalanced/unusual bitter beer. I can’t find much to enjoy from this glass, really, and I can’t help wondering if the yeasts’ continuing work in the bottle has killed off those more pleasant characters this beer was meant to deliver?  ",3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,3,3.36

Old-school pine tar blast upfront with a touch of buttery malt underneath. Smells like an APA on steroids. An IPA? Citrus notes come through upfront. It's brewed with mango and passionfruit. The mango is more apparent and works well with the hops used. Lingering mango and passionfruit make up the mouthfeel. Alcohol heat is there too. Very nice. I would prefer it if the alcohol level was dialed down. However, if you age it, you will probably taste more of the mango and passionfruit and less of the alcohol itself.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.53

The maple syrup seemed to cut some of the bourbon/oaky notes and blend together very well. Slight alcohol warming on the very back.

Does not appear particularly thick or viscous, but this beer definitely has legs. S – Rich chocolate with light vanilla and oak notes, all relatively subdued. A touch of honey-like sweetness (presumably related to the maple syrup). Perhaps some floral or woodsy hop notes, not much detectable. T – Vanilla is very high, followed by milk chocolate and a hint of maple, similar to French toast. Hops are earthy, maybe some light fruit, mostly contributing bitterness which rides along with sweetness on the finish. M – Carbonation if fairly low, though quite present. Body is moderate-thick, not oily but slightly slick. Stays fairly juicy and sweet throughout, with bitterness on the finish to balance and both lingering on the aftertaste. O – I certainly am aware of the accolades this beer has received and its white whale status, and it is certainly worthy of some of the hype. I got to try it thanks to some fortunate timing, and am glad that I did. In a vacuum, this is an excellent imperial / barrel-aged stout, and the maple definitely shows in the final product.

47658,Zaximus,2015-05-20,"   0% On tap a Maria's as part of CCBW. I was fully expecting to be a bit disappointed by this offering but was thrilled when that turned out not to be the case. Sweet but well balanced. The coffee and bourbon are toned down here in comparison to KBS and play very well together with the maple. Rich, creamy mouthfeel. Well hidden alcohol. I'd love to see this in attainable bottles at some point. Guessing others may feel the same.  ",4.25,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.66

47658,CTbrew32,2015-05-19,"   On tap at Oak & Ore in OKC. Black in color with a thin mocha head. Aroma is a mix of bourbon, chocolate, and maple sweetness and some coffee bitterness. In the taste the bourbon barrel is strong at first,, eventually giving way to a chocolate and subtle maple syrup sweetness. The sweetness continues into the finish with the addition of coffee bitterness as well. Feel is very full bodied and low in carbonation. Overall, the combo of maple and bourbon makes for a delicious sweetness that is perfectly balanced with the coffee bitterness. Definitely a world a world class beer with very few quality alternatives of the same style, which for that reason alone makes this a must try even if it requires a little extra effort.  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5

227065,the_brew_man,2018-02-25,"   Poured dark caramel almost pitch black. Poor head retention. This bottle was bottle-aged since 2017 release. Smell was a little too charred/roasted which killed the coconut aroma. Boring aroma overall. honestly smelled like a cheap stout. Tasted the same way as it smelled. The coffee and coconut adjuncts lacked balance. It was probably due to the coffee bean roast and pH at which it was brewed at. Vanilla came out as the beer warmed up but didn't blend well on the palate with the other flavors. Turned into a boozy-charred flat vanilla mess. Honestly, this beer is extremely hyped. I feel as if the only ones who get to try this beer and rate it are diehard wakefield fans who consider all his works a success. Definitely not the case here.  ",3,2,2.25,2.5,2.25,2.26

Hop bitterness is a little more dank and pronounced than some of their other beers, it definitely drinks a little ""bigger"" than beers like Julius and Green. Malts have a caramel quality to them which increases the richness. Mouthfeel has the TH signature creaminess. Appearance is hazy and beautiful, laces well but not quite as nicely as their regular IPAs. In terms of the alcohol bite it is very slightly perceptible. I don't understand what goes on at that brewery or how they figured this out, but they seem to be incapable of making anything less than excellent beer.  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.49

Smells of herbal coffee and dark chocolate up front, followed by undertones of coconut, vanilla and caramel. Tastes of bitter earthy coffee up front with vanilla leading the way of the adjuncts. Coconut note is very light. The finish gives some charred malt and more coffee, as well as a bit of alcohol. Medium-heavy body with low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and a warming finish, abs hidden pretty well.

47658,StoutHunter,2015-05-12,"   I got a snifter of Founder's Canadian Breakfast Stout today at Big E's Sports Grill. I've been wanting to try this beer for more than a few years and I pretty much gave up on being able to try the newest batch, but I was lucky to be able to get a glass right before the keg kicked, so lets see how it goes. 2014 Vintage. A- It poured a nice looking black color that didn't let any light come through and it had a finger and half worth of slightly creamy darker tan head that died down top a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left plenty of patchy lacing behind. This is a very nice looking beer, I have no complaints. S- The aroma starts off with a lower amount of higher sweetness with t the malts being the first to show up and they impart some nice roasted malt and sweet malt aromas with a good amount of chocolate coming through along with a lighter coffee aroma. Up next comes a nice maple syrup aroma that goes right into the barrels which impart some nice boozy, vanilla and lighter bourbon aromas with just enough oak aromas coming through. This beer has a very nice aroma, but the boozy aromas are a little heavy. T- The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with the a lower amount of higher sweetness with the malts still being the first to show up and they impart the same roasted malt aspects with some chocolate and a light coffee flavors coming through. Up next comes the maple syrup which impart a nice natural maple syrup aroma and it's followed by a somewhat light boozy flavor. On the finish comes the barrels which impart the same nice bourbon aspects that it did in the aroma and on the finish there's no bitterness with some boozy sweetness taking it's place and it had a nice maple syrup, chocolate and bourbon like aftertaste. This is a great tasting beer, it's got great balance and while it is sweeter than KBS I find that maple syrup sweetness helps bridge the malts and the bourbon barrels together. M- Fairly smooth, velvety, not too crisp, a little creamy, full bodied with a lower amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel was great and it worked well with this beer. Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of the style, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style and it turned out to be a very tasty beer and it lived up to being even better than KBS. This beer had good drinkability, i would have no problem drinking a few snifters of it. What I like the most about this beer was the balance and complexity they were the highlights of this beer. What I like the least about this beer is the boozy aroma, i wish it was hidden a little better. I would for sure buy this beer again on draft and hopefully in bottles one day. I highly recommend this beer, I think ti's a must try for every craft beer drinker. All in all I really enjoyed this beer and it lived up to the hype, I had to really search this beer out, but I thought it was worth it. It's my new favorite Founders beer and it's the best barrel aged stout I've had. Fantastic job guys, this was a world class beer.  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.68

47658,Roguer,2015-05-11,"   Extremely dark brown, nearly black, shot through with purple highlights. Nice dark tan head. Great retention and nice lacing. Oily sheen lasts on top the brew. Aroma is hot, boozy, deep, dark, inviting. Nuts, maple syrup, coffee, caramel, dark fruit. Flavor is big, sweet, boozy, and thick. The sweetness is immediately noticeable but not dominating: dark fruit, maple syrup, and bourbon. Chocolate, coffee, and oak. Bitter and roasty, but balanced. Thick and dense flavors. Really presents quite well, with nothing overpowering or artificial. Very thick mouthfeel; long wet finish; slightly hot, but not bad for the ABV. This is perhaps the cleanest, purest expression of a very specific style. Perhaps no beer in the world is worth the hype we in this community build up, but this is a fantastic beer.  ",4.5,4,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.41

It has a simply amazing aroma, followed by an incredibly vibrant flavor. I pick up a lot of citrusy and tropical fruit on the nose, with passionfruit, guava and mango being the most distinct. The flavor is lightly bitter with this great tropical fruit flavor and finish. Hoppy enough to satisfy my IPA-itch, while floral and fragrant enough that I’d share it with those friends who could care less for any IBUS. Fantastic.  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.73

78043,BEERchitect,2013-02-01,"   I have it in good faith that no actual baby tigers were harmed in the making of this pale ale. But for the mangoes and passion fruit- I feel that it is was a blood bath! The hyper pale ale pours with a density and richness in color that's exorbitant for standard pale ales. But pushing upwards of eight percent, the added malt gives the beer more visual weight as well. Deep amber and copper colors come together for a rather rusty haze. A loosely knit head of ivory foam tops the beer with randomness, interspersed lace, and reluctant staying power. The balance of fruit and malt come together in a very pale ale kind of way. But the aromas are all heightened to nearly imperial status. Caramel, light toast and biscuit form the first half of the scent while citrus and tropical fruits bring up the rear. Mangoes and passion fruit are more obvious tones of tropical influence but the citrus is all hops. The beer's delicious taste is equal to its aromas, except more real. The same balance of toasted and caramelized to tropical and citrus holds true. However, the sweetness of caramel and bread crust saturate the front of the mouth while the citrus hop impressions and mango, passion fruit additions give a riper and juicier sweetness. Fruit acidity offers just as much of a balance in finish as do the hop bitterness. Still, the beer balances evenly from early palate 'til aftertaste with tremendous consistency. Medium, medium, and more medium- this pale ale starts just as creamy and dry as it finishes. Surprisingly for a heightened pale ale, the beer doesn't feel fuller than it does. Creamy carbonation and moderate residual sweetness provides a pleasant upstart that develops into an extended finish of soft sweetness, mild bitterness, alcohol warmth and light fruit acidity. Tiger Baby is a very pleasant pale ale of high proportions. Though there's really no flaws, there's not a ton to celebrate above the normal prescriptions of pale ales. It's simply a nice and effortless session on all fronts.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

Sounds bad but works very well T some lemon rind and slightly sweet and sour, still good with the same tropical notes from the nose but its lacking the intensity M a little left behind in the mouth and creamy from the bubbles almost to the point of foam but it stops short, nice tropical notes linger O hits the spot and sinks like a ship, smells awesome and I have little to complain about in other areas I didn’t know what to expect and I wasn’t expecting a fruit beer but it was a pleasant surprise.

There was was no head retention, but there was some at first, this also could have been due to the growler getting filled the day before. Smell: Sweet, malty goodness. Not really any tea aroma. Taste: Sweet, malty spice, slightly roasty on the back end. Mouthfeel: A lighter dubbel, which I was it to be nice that it was not super heavy. Overall: $12 for a 64 ounce Growler from Piggly Wiggly in Myrtle Beach. Was impressed with highland stepping outside of the box and doing something a little higher in alcohol content. Most of their normally run 5 - 6 %. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a nice belgian style beer.  ",,,,,,4

Nose shows heavy tropical fruit, but seemingly more from hops than actual fruit, with an accompanying grapefruit and pine character. The fruit isn't evident as a flavour, focussing more on pine, grapefruit and some grainy malt. Carbonation is too high.  ",3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.27
78043,4000qtrap,2012-09-09,"   Source/Serving: 22oz bottle S: Intense, mesmerizing guava, pineappple, lime and grapefruit that is well integrated with a hefty dose of caramel malt. Fruit flavors are very refined, multi-dimensional, and not out of balance. Hints of mango and the fruit character has serious depth with pleasant notes of pit as well as fruit skin. Herbal hop character is well represented and works well. T: Fairly heavy maltiness hits hard at first, but is just slightly sweet. Has a nice, nuanced red fruit/toffee malt character that stays subtle and doesn’t overwhelm. The middle is balanced, nicely sweet and bitter. Lots of fresh grapefruit, hints of fresh herbs, lemon and lime. Fresh, lively, and refreshing. A caramel, brown sugar malty foundation just below the surface holding everything together. Has a hint of dry, fruit skin astringency but not much. Grapefruit and lime pop in the finish which has a nice, dry herbal note as it lingers for a lengthy time. Less bitter than most APAs, but I'm ok with that. Its still an APA and works better this way with the fruit. Notes: The beer has a lot of complex fruit notes but its not overly 'fruity'. Its refined and constrained and not overwhelming. Very interesting brew, better than I anticipated and I love the exotic fruit notes.  ",4,5,5,3.5,4.5,4.69

78043,biboergosum,2012-08-28,"   330ml bottle. A more appropriate 5% ABV on this batch. ""Melancholic pop songs""? What, Danish hipsters? Gag. This beer pours a mildly hazy golden amber hue, with two fingers of foamy, bubbly dirty white head, which still leaves some nice Swiss cheese lace around the glass as it rashly recedes. It smells of fruity caramel malt - mushy pineapple, guava, under ripe mango, and some green leafy hops. The taste is more tropical fruitiness, the musty mango joined by some subtle blood orange and aged kiwi, all over a softly crackery, grainy, and weakly caramelized malt, with a waft of tamely bitter leafy, musty hops. The carbonation is soft, but not inert, still going about its job gamely, the body a middling medium weight, with the pithy fruitiness take some wind out of the smoothness sails. It finishes off-dry, and all fruit, the malt wondering why its tail is still between its legs, and the seemingly out-sourced bittering hops continuing to earn their measly paycheck. A decent APA, with a huge fruit uptick - if ya like the exotic-ish fruitiness, this should be right up your alley, even if it kind of overshadows anything else plying its trade here.  ",4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.85
78043,metter98,2012-08-20,"   On-tap at Mugs Alehouse, Brooklyn, NY A: The beer is hazy yellowish amber in color and has a very slight amount of carbonation. It poured with a thin but dense off white head that eventually died down, leaving a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. S: There are moderately strong aromas of mango in the nose. T: The taste is similar to the smell and has flavors of mango and citrus along with a light amount of carbonation. M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. O: This beer is very tasty for the style as it is packed with lots of hop flavors. It seems like you are almost drinking an IPA, except that it lacks the hop bitterness.  ",3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,4.02

Constant and evenly-spread carbonation- fast, tiny bubbles. Orange, orange peel, mango, and sweet hops in the nose. Very resinous hop taste, incredibly drinkable and light for 8% ABV; a real juicy and easy leave with hardly any bitterness. Mouthfeel is impressive in that this beer could be mistaken for a ~5% pale, while it is infact a pretty burly PA.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4
78043,brystmar,2012-08-13,"   On tap at Mug's. Murky, ominous orange-brown body retains its head well. Mango, hops, and malt in the nose, all of which carry through to the taste. Immediate fruity tingle on your tongue as soon as the glass meets your lips. Lightly tart passionfruit & mango start things off, leaving a lemon-citrus aftertaste in the back of the throat. Hop character is balanced well, though they don't taste very fresh. A good blend, would be better closer to the kegging date. Arguably the best hop-forward beer from Mikkeller to date.  ",4.5,4,4,4,4,4.03

78043,ThePorterSorter,2012-08-08,"   The beer pours a rich looking amber with half an inch of a creamy, off-white head that fades quickly. The nose is quite bitter with big notes of tropical fruit and alcohol. It has a surprisingly hoppy aroma despite the fruit addition, but this is not uncharacteristic of the style. The fruit is far more pronounced in the taste (compared to the nose) and even more so when the beer is given a chance to warm. There is a slight acidity from the fruits giving this beer an interestingly dry mouthfeel. The body is rich, but there is plenty of carbonation to make it refreshing as expected when drinking an APA. The aftertaste is slightly tart, bitter, sweet, and semi-dry...at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and also mikkeller's take on an APA that incorporates some of the actual fruits which many attribute to the various hop profiles seen in APAs today. And surprisingly this beer is pretty well priced!  ",4,4,4,4.5,4,4.05
78043,womencantsail,2012-07-30,"   On-tap at Bruery Provisions Pours a hazed orange color with a dense khaki head. A sweet and fruity aroma which has a fair amount of citrus and a light tropical note to it. Decently malty with a touch of floral hops. The flavor has a light to moderate bitterness with a similarly fruity quality as exhibited on the nose. Fairly bready with a citric finish. Not as tropical/mango heavy as I had hoped, but good.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4
78043,drpimento,2012-07-14,"   Wow, an amazing pale ale brewed with unusual fruit! Poured at a good temperature with a colossal, cream-colored, foamy, frothy, thick head that slowly settles and some lace. Color is a not quite clear, dark amber with loads of bubble trails. Aroma is a very fragrant hop, fruit, grass, malt, caramel. Flavor's like nose, carbonic tang and passion fruit up front, with hop, mango, some sweet and bitter after. Body is great; ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, fairly long, great burps, and I sure wish I had more than this one bottle. Superior pale ale!  ",4.5,5,5,5,4.5,4.87

78043,claspada,2012-07-02,"   Pours a semi-hazy copper color with a medium size creamy colored head that leaves minimal lacing. Aromas begin quite fruity from both the fruit additions and the hops. Mango, pineapple, citrus just to name a few. As it warms I get more of the pleasant floral hops and passion fruit sweetness. Decent pale malt backbone as well. The tastes follow the nose with the passion fruit and light citrus fruit and hops flavors opening up. Mango and more bright citrus fruits emerge as well. Not particularly bitter but very balanced and drinkable for an 8% ABV beer; probably too drinkable to be honest. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation for the sytle. Finish is fruity, slightly creamy/sweet but also pleasantly dry. Really balanced I guess is the best way to put it. Overall I really enjoyed this beer; I can't say I agree with calling a beer an American Pale Ale when it is 8% ABV but it really kind of is. Not too bitter or hoppy. The fruit additions balance out the hops nicely and make for a super dangerously drinkable beer.  ",3.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.09

78043,thagr81us,2012-07-02,"   Big thanks goes out to my doppelganger for sharing this one sitting by the pool in the recent 100+ °F weather! Served from bottle into a shaker. Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, passion fruit, spices, mango, fruit hop, and very subtle citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, mango, passion fruit, and fruit hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I really like how the fruit in this one played a major role. This made it quite refreshing for an extremely hot day out in the sun while not being too invasive on the palate while enjoying it. A well done brew by Mikkeller that I wouldn't mind having again someday.  ",4,4,3.5,4,4,3.8
78043,lacqueredmouse,2012-06-23,"   750ml bottle purchased from Berkeley Bowl in Berkeley, CA. Pours a very hazed, almost opaque orange-gold colour, with a solid and relatively fine just off-white head. Lacing is patchy, but very fine and intricate where it forms. Solid body, in fact surprisingly so when tilted. Looks good. Nose is big and fruity, although it's hard to tell what comes from hops and what comes from the added fruit. Passionfruit certainly gets lost and confused with a bright, acidic and heady, almost spicily intoxicating hop fragrance, but the mango seeps in as a broad sweetness across the entire nose. Ooh. It's a lovely aroma. Taste is light and clean, with a noticeable hop presence that never feels unbalanced. Although the malt character is very neutral, it has enough heft to survive and balance the beer. The fruit again gets masked somewhat on the palate—either it mingles with a deep fine sweetness, or into the sharp, zingy, fruity hops. I feel like it's well-used nonetheless. Feel is long but smooth. It works really well. Overall, really great work, Messrs. Mikkeller. Always a pleasure trying something new from these guys, and they've turned what seemed like an interesting experiment on the bottle, into a thoroughly drinkable and approachable beer.  ",4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.27

53279,StonedTrippin,2012-04-18,"   one of the better 4% drafts at red rock. pours a semitransparent smokey black color with a dim amber glow when held to the light. only a very small off white head sits on top. smells a bit smokey, not quite rauchbier smokey, but it gives a nice rich character to the aroma. also dark german malts permeate in the smell. flavor is roasty but light in body for the color of the beer. malt driven for sure, but well balanced to the degree that the finish is quick and bitter. feel is a little undercarbonated, but ive run into that a lot in schwarzbiers for some reason. the low abv works with this one as its a very sessionable pint. quite enjoyable with a wide variety of menu items, especially the woodfired pizzas. edit: recipe has evolved i think. a recent growler fill proved to be much darker and richer, almost not even lagered, carbonated to high heaven. still yummy, but different than i remember from a couple of years ago!  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.6
53279,mentor,2011-11-07,"   A bottle left over after GABF judging and given to me as a reward for my volunteer efforts. Pours finger of light brown head over a pitch liquid with brown edgings when held to light. Smells dry roasty with caramel and a bit of cream. Sour cherry-like from black malt and a bit of nut. The head settled to a thin creamy layer, reminiscent of what I'd expect to see in an oatmeal stout. Tastes dry roasty, sun-baked nougat, with a soothing creaminess. Strong earthy hop flavor that makes it to the finish and modest grassy hop bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. Light in the mouth and finishes dry. Medium carbonation. May be the most drinkable schwartzbier I've ever had.  ",4.5,4,4,4,4,4.03

47965,tavernjef,2009-02-15,"   Special Valentines Day brew served on-tap in a 10oz goblet - Firm chocolatey brown color with a slim compact head of smoothed over dark tan foam. Aroma is a welcoming array of fresh tartish raspberry and milky chocolate, which gains more nosey power as it sits and heads towards the bottom of the glass. Seemingly becomes like a bunch of tootsie rolls melted into some fresh raspberries at that point. Flavors are spot on terrific! A perfect delightful match of fresh tangy, snappy, crisp, tart, and juicy raspberry and an excellently balanced mellowing milky chocolate backing. Absolutley lovely! Very akin to Kuhnhenn's Rasp Eisbock if not a complete near mirror image for taste. Body is a mellowing soft and tangy mediumness. At first when served chilled, its quite crisp and snappy, but as it warms it really comes into its own with one hell of a finely mellowing creamy milk tone thats quite nice and easy to drink. The balance is remarkably set between the raspberry bite and the tender smooth milk chocolate. An absolute treat to behold. Gonna have to see if its still there for some growlers ASAP.  ",,,,,,4.55

The nose is very much so an imperial IPA, It has a nice floral hop character and intense citrus notes. A very fruity smelling beer. The taste is totally different, the beer doesn't have the strong hop character the name implies but its still quite citrusy. Unlike most IPA's, this beer is not very biter and is instead, quite sour. Not at all what nose implied but it was modest and quite nice. The overall beer doesnt have a very strong flavor but isnt bad to sip on. Its feel is pretty nice. A nice sized body and good drink ability. Overall. This beer was pretty good, I wish the beer had the dominant hop flavor that I got from the nose. And I liked how the beer was more sour then bitter which is a nice change of pace. Worth trying but probably not your best option.  ",4,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.92

227065,M_chav,2017-02-11,"   Originally rated Big Poppa b1, this was my take on the Big Poppa b2 when we tasted it next to Makaveli: Makaveli pours a viscous, thin-brown foamed top. Slightly bigger bubbles compared to the Big Poppa, coming in at 10.8% abv I noticed it was quite a bit less than the untappd information on Big Poppa b2 - 16%. Big Poppa pours a super thick black with little to no head, looks a bit more viscous. Makaveli aroma is alllllll vanilla, takes over the nostrils, super creamy and thick smell, heaven. Big Poppa is super coffee forward, roasted coffee beans, its hard to get past that part, it's nice, but they are distinctly different. Makaveli tastes big and bold and full of flavor, the vanilla shines yet again it's delicious. Big Poppa is a bit more coffee again but not as much as the nose would lead you to believe, vanilla is in the background with adjuncts a bit less pronounced but complex. In the mouthfeel, Makaveli is packing a strange slight tang in the end- not my favorite finish to what was before such an awesome bottle. Big Poppa finished super thick and chewy. Overall both were nothing short of excellent, I'm happy that two beers could be the same take on a recipe and style and be so appropriately named.

47658,Get_Lowell,2015-04-23,"   2011 batch opened in 2014. Look: Pitch black with a decent layer of tan foam Smell: Maple syrup, chocolate, caramel. Taste: More maple syrup with very noticeable licorice notes. It's amazing that the syrup degrades over time into licorice, I never would have anticipated that. Lot's of chocolate in there as well. A fresh batch would be quite a different experience. Feel: Very smooth overall, medium body, kind of wish it was a bit chewier. Overall: I loved drinking this and I am really happy to have tried the 2011 batch. It's an excellent experience in the effects of aging beer and how the taste can change considerably.  ",4.5,4.75,4.5,4,4.75,4.56

There is some light malt sweetness on the front end, but it is the dank, grapefruit and earthy, spicy hop presence that plays the greatest role. A soft mouthfeel, which I've found typical of Tree House hoppy concoctions. This is a very good DIPA.  ",3.75,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.34

258290,aleigator,2017-08-28,"   Pours entirely black with a foamy, dark brown head, which dissipates immediately. Smells of sweet and flowery coconut oil, together with complimenting bakers chocolate and a hint of licorice. Has a lingering toffee presence, which goes very well with the coconut, pointing this into a sweeter direction. Has a lower carbonation, not flat yet, with a not overly pronounced sweetness, making this, as for its lighter body, almost easy drinkable. Coconut hits you from the very beginning, mellow, with a floral hint to it, coated up by toffee and milk chocolate. Although there is no sign of roast or bitterness to be detected, this remains enjoyable on the palate, due to its smooth, almost silk mouthfeel. The coconut does have a candy bar taste to it though, lots of sugar, which comes along a little artificial, since the chocolate flavors arent able to balance it out entirely. Finishes almost watery, since the coconut receeded very quickly and doesn't leave much behind it, with the exeption of semi spicy licorice. Not a big fan, since this is a little too one dimensional, relying on an adjunct, which doesn't really deliver.  ",3.75,3.75,3,3,3,3.23

T: Tasted of a fair shot of citrus fruit (lemon, orange), a bit of sweet malt (mostly in the finish), lots of hops (not too much, though), a creamy quality, and tropical fruits (papaya, mango). Even though this not quite as aggressive as some other DIPA flavors, it's very sweet, subtle and focused. Quite delicious. F: A well-carbonated beer with a smooth, creamy finish. Medium-bodied.

The aroma is quite pungent and certainly fruit-forward. It also happens to be the best aspect of this beer. The mango and passion fruit really do shine in an authentic, vibrant way, along with some sweeter citrus candy notes and some caramel and mild pine. The flavor too is fruit forward with a moderate level of bitterness, candy sweetness, a touch of pine, and some very minor medicinal notes, though they are not distracting. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Certainly my favorite hop-forward beer I've had from Mikkeller--by a long shot.  ",4,4,3.5,4,4,3.8

Modest head that dissipates first to a loose diffuse thing of big bubbles and down to a film in a couple minutes. S - Wonderful perfumy sweet tropical fruit/mango and bittery hop smell come together to form a smell that reminds me of honeysuckle. Later in the glass I get a low level malt. T - Tastes really nice but I think smells even better. I get the passion fruit on the exhale after swallowing. Zero booze. There's a modest hop presence that's more feel/dryness than taste, but a moderate bitter tang is left behind in the aftertaste. There's a little citrus tartness leftover too. M - Light and carbonatey tingly. Very refreshing. O - A subtle and wonderful combination of flavors and sensations. What a winner for late spring early summer outside and sunny. Mine may be old enough that I don't get as strong a hop presence as I would have fresh, not sure, but I don't care. I like it like it is. If I could change it, maybe I'd want a little more ass on it, but that could interfere with how refreshing it is so maybe not.  ",3.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.09

The smell has sweet passion fruit, tons of it, tropical fruits in general, nettles and grass. The taste starts with surprisingly unsweet, then a sourness that is not entirely pleasant, old lime juice, grape-fruit seed and peel bitterness. Little carbonation, thin body, a watery feeling, very dry finish. Had expected more from Mikkel, but even the sun has spots.  ",4,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.08
78043,Stinkypuss,2012-04-05,"   Mikkeller : Tiger Baby : open windows open hills Pours a deep gold bordering on orange. Head retention is OK with some lacing. Aroma is quite fruity and hop laden, with bright citrus, mango and pine aromas. In the taste, solidly bitter upfront with some tropical fruit flavour going on (mango, pineapple). Very nice bitter, and if served cold the mango and passionfruit are really down played. As the beer warms up, more of the added fruit flavors come in, with a mild passion fruit sweetness and more tropical notes. Just a touch of brett lending a soft funk. Alcohol is well masked. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and semi dry. Overall, a fine pale ale and nice hop character.  ",3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.12

T: the citrus was definitely there on the flavor alongside passion fruit, some tart notes, hoppy bretty character with dry grapfruit qualities and a touch of herbs.

It tastes like mango, citrusy and floral hops, and a bit of bready malt. There's also a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little creamy and has a good amount of carbonation.

78043,kojevergas,2012-03-16,"   1 pint 9.4 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a Port Brewing taster glass. Reviewed live. Expectations are high given the brewery. Acquired at Wally's Wine in Westwood, California. Served refrigerator cold and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. A: Pours a one finger head of no real cream, okay thickness, and fairly bad retention. Colour is a semitransparent copper. No yeast particles are visible. Sm: Pleasant floral hops and passion fruit esters. A mild to moderate strength aroma. Certainly inviting. T: Pleasantly floral and estery, with passion fruit and light citrusy notes. No alcohol comes through. Mango is present when I look for it. Very fruity and fresh. Very well balanced and built. I like the bright fruits. Quite refreshing and enjoyable. Has a tropical feel to an extent. Not particularly complex or subtle, but it doesn't need to be to satisfy what it's going for. Mf: Smooth and wet, with enough coarseness to bring out the flavours. Thick enough. Adequately carbonated without being overly so. Dr: Very drinkable, especially for the high ABV. I'd get it again, preferably on draught. Hides its ABV incredibly well. A lovely pale ale. A bit pricey, but quite nice. Fans of the style will love it. It drank just fine out of my Port Brewing taster glass. Would pair well with any food. Low B  ",2,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.56

255299,Lone_Freighter,2017-09-01,"   Poured into a stemmed pilsener to replicate a stange yet to somewhat treat like a normal altbier but figured a little ""lift"" at the bottom because of barrel aging. The appearance was a nice looking semi-dark brown color with a chill haze running about it at the edges. Milky sticky foamy lace ran around the sides of the glass. The aroma had a nice sweet to bitter dark chocolate powder flowing over some crisp sweet to sour brett character and then providing a little bit of a crisp little wafer-like edge (guessing that's the altbier coming out). The flavor was moderately sweet with a quaint bitterness stiffing up the sour-ness brittling out the dark chocolate nibs and/or powder. Aftertaste was sour with the dark chocolate nibs and/or powder coming through in a fashionable sort of manner. The mouthfeel was almost medium bodied with a fair sipping quality about it as the ""sour"" harshness did take a good hold for a sly acidic feature. But that dark chocolate did make a good effort to try and smooth out the ""sour"" edges fairly nice. Overall, altbier? Hmmmmmmm...not quite sure, I wish I found a date on the bottle but don't see any as I believe this is further along in it's aging. Still, for me at least, I really liked it and would probably lean closer to recommending to sour fans than altbier fans. Oh and one more thing, what's nice about this beer is that there are remnants of it reminding me a little bit of Anchorage's Anadromous (that Brett with the dark chocolate notes, that's really nice).  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

99844,JISurfer,2013-09-26,"   This was a one keg brew by Westbrook for the Charleston Beer Exchange. It was released on 9/26/13 as the rare beer for Rare Beer Tuesday. I'd say, one keg ever made, is quite rare. I'm a huge fan of the Citrus Ninja Exchange, which is what this one is, but this batch was brewed with Habaneros. A - Cloudy straw with a decent head that quickly dissipated to a thin lacing. S - The citrusy hops hit you up front, almost like hoppy orange juice, then fades to fresh cut peppers. T - Taste is definitely citrusy hop forward, but then the slow burn of the peppers takes over. The finish is like you literally bit into a pepper off the plant, very fresh tasting. My tongue is numb, but I like it. M - Just as stated before, the tongue goes numb, then the throat follows shortly after. It lets you know that there's habaneros in there. O - Another great beer from Westbrook. I'm glad I got to try this one off, especially as I am really starting to get into the peppery beers. This one has some cojones for sure. Any pepper beer that makes me sweat is good in my book. Not sure if I could drink it everyday, but it's definitely worthy.  ",3.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.17

78043,rudzud,2012-03-01,"   Picked up a bottle of this at Julio's. Shared with bpk59. A - Pours a hazy golden orange hue with a one finger white foamy head that leaves a nice thick blanket and big clumpy side lacing. S - LOTS of mango here. Nice orange citrus notes, very similar to heady topper just with mango instead of pine. T - LOTS of mango, just like the nose. Huge mango notes and good pine. This is just full of bright tropical notes. Never had a beer this fresh from Mikkeller. Incredibly enjoyable. M - Nice carbonation here for an APA. Slightly creamy but not flat or thin by any means. Really compliments the beer. O - Overall, wow. One of my favourite beers from Mikkeller hands down. I mean, I cant get over how bright, crisp, and fresh this beer comes across. Really wish I pulled the trigger on this and went for more. $14.99 per 750mL isnt bad for a beer this tasty.  ",4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.42

78043,Phyl21ca,2012-02-02,   Bottle: Poured a light hazy orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of citrus and bitter hops is quite dominant with light malt presence. Taste is also dominated by light citrus notes with some bitter hops and malt backbone is semi-sweet with limited impact on the overall flavour profile. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Interesting but not sure if there was supposed to be some mango in this beer as my Danish isn’t that good but can’t say I tasted them if there was any.  ,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.7

47658,rodmanfor3,2015-04-17,"   Excellent. Best stout I have had to date. The maple syrup flavor is amazing. Though it will not see bottles again for years (according to the Founders rep), this beer is worth seeking out on draft whenever available. Bottles that remain are certainly worth trading for. Edit: July 2016 On draft at a couple of accounts in Vermont as a bonus treat courtesy of the Founders team following Brewfest. This beer, while still amazing, has fallen off. The maple notes are distant and the chocolate flavor has turned to more of a licorice profile. Definitely still worth drinking but not with the expectations that it will taste as great as the 2015 draft and growler fill versions. Edit: 2018 The newly bottled version of CBS falls somewhere above KBS and significantly below most of the world class barrel-aged stouts that exist out on the market today. Overall, I think that CBS was one of those legendary beers that simply could not be reproduced on a mass scale.  ",4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.56

47658,schris,2015-04-12,"   0% In my view, pretty much every imperial stout would be improved if the carbonation were smoothed out to the level of this batch of CBS. I had an 8oz pour, served at around 55 degrees at a tapping event this spring. The maple flavor, while a solid core of the beer, was still subtle enough that it didn't mask the beautiful roasty malts. Rather, it made its influence known by being present at the nose, on contact, and as a lingering whisper at the finish. I was surprised to find I didn't smell much coffee, despite a robust initial head of about 1cm. But if I hadn't been expecting coffee, I wouldn't have missed it. Overall, a beautiful sweet balanced gem, that I may never get to try again. (I hope I do.)  ",4.75,4.25,4.75,5,4.75,4.66

125646,maximum12,2015-09-23,"   Thanks to jakehoodlum for this 16 oz. silver can, in that seemingly east coast minimalist slap-a-label on a can blank style. Drunking by myself in a hotel room, working, watching the Twins, wild-card bound! The pour is golden yellow with a solid white cap & active bubbles that are visible even through the (h)aze. Nose clocks in at strong oranges & more nebulous fruit tones with a sweet smile. Not bad. Haze is what I’d be in if I had a four-pack of this. White Bronco hit & run of bitterness right on kick-off, with no time for any of the knicker-twisting fruits that too many IPAs are veering towards. Underneath the sneering is classic citrus, light mango & apricot, other tropicals, & just a pinch of white pepper. The finish goes slightly grainy with downslope pine, but the bitterness is what really kicks the ending. I could drink a lot of this; matter of fact, I already have. Why does my glass look so empty? Who’s stealing my beer? Unlike some of its east coast compatriots, this is an IPA & not a pale ale with a Chevy lift kit bolted on. Bitter blast, tasty fruitiness, & a ridiculous drinkability that’s just this side of a beer bong. I only have one more of these? I will be cradling it lovingly when I return home. This is an excellent beer that’s only one thin mint away from joining the elite. EDIT: after not wanting to brush my teeth last night & thinking about this beer several times today, I can't figure why I didn't give this a ""5"" on taste. A world-class IIPA.  ",4.5,4,5,4.5,5,4.68

Aromas of rich cocoa nibs, coffee, vanilla, hints of maple, woody highlights, and a bourbon undertone. Flavors are rich and sweet forward, with bittersweet chocolate blending perfectly with vanilla and maple. Wow! Backbone of subtle coffee, hints of bourbon, and a building warmth. The body is smooth, creamy, and velvety smooth. There is a candy sweet aftertaste of chocolate, maple, and vanilla. It's like an awesome piece of candy.

47658,SeanBond,2015-04-07,"   I'll be the first to admit that I'm a skeptic by nature; I generally assume ""whales"" are going to be overrated, and when it's a coffee stout I try it only out of obligation, because I'm not a coffee stout guy. CBS is one of the extremely rare times that I've found the hype to be completely justified, and I've got to admit I'm really surprised. I don't like FBS, and I think KBS is vastly overhyped, so to find out that CBS is not only worthy of praise, but that I actually really like it is crazy to me. On to the beer. Pours a nice, small brown head. The beer itself isn't quite black, but it's very dark, and pretty thick. I didn't do a lot of smelling (too busy pouring it into my face), but there was a nice intermingling of coffee/bourbon and a hint of maple. But who cares, because the taste is next. Alright, wow. Lots of chocolate in the taste (and when I say chocolate, I mean that it actually tastes like fudge, not like it gives an impression of a ""chocolate-like flavor""), and a nice, mellow coffee. There are hints of maple, but that side mostly adds sweetness and counters the coffee. This is important, because I dislike coffee in my stouts, and this is the first time I've tasted one that's so well-integrated. There's more balance to this beer than I expected; most coffee stouts come across as very coffee-forward and bitter, while this beer is the opposite. In fact, this might be the only time that I've accepted coffee in a stout as a necessary factor (to balance the maple sweetness). Up to this point, BCBCS was my favorite coffee stout--I didn't love it, but I really liked it, despite the coffee. I've tried a bunch of the better coffee stouts out there, and never really been blown away, until now. Is this my favorite stout? No; I still like a few of the Bourbon Counties better, and I'm still generally going to prefer stouts without coffee. However, I can honestly say that this is now on my list of must-try beers when they go on tap (or bottle sale), and is one of my favorites. Phenomenal job by Founders; if only they could make this with more frequency.  ",4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.75,4.75

The nose was a bit soft but playful with light coffee, oak wood, chocolate and bourbon. The front end displayed a delicious and decadent chocolate that opened to a roasted coffee. The bourbon is subtle with some added caramel and toffee. The funny thing is that the maple is ever present, never pervasive and blends seamlessly throughout. This is so smooth and velvety that it really lives up to the hype.  ",4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.69

262701,StonedTrippin,2017-09-28,"   an absolutely amazing barrel aged stout with maple syrup and coffee. the maple here is incredible, super natural and heavy handed in here, thick and viscous, its flavor as well as its texture come through. it also brings out some of the cool woody features of the barrel, and works well with the vanilla note in the whiskey too. this is the right amount of sweetness for the maple to be there, but not have the beer give me diabetes. heavy chocolate notes and deep roast from the malt brings up the coffee roast too, earthy with sweet cocoa and toffee notes, nice with both the maple and the whiskey in here. maybe some vanilla too. gosh this is good, so thick that it evolves and goes down slow, letting me get to enjoy each wrinkle as it passes along, coffee is the right bitterness for balance, and the maple is as good as it gets. the base beer on its own must be a winner too, roasty and rich, heavenly with its luxurious body and long finish. i have been absolutely blown away by these guys in limited exposure, and am frothing to get into more of their beers. this barrel aged sherpa series is insanely good, and the maple one is my favorite among them. an absolute standout!  ",4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.49

59006,John_M,2016-02-18,"   Picked up a bottle of this the other day at the Sonoma Whole Foods. Part of the problem with buying beer here, is that unless the beer is super popular (like bottle of PtE), it's not an usual to see stuff languish on the shelf. Several IPA's had been there on the shelf for several months, from what I could tell, including a 6 month old bottle of knee keep Hoptologist (which I was thinking of getting). There was a fairly good size row of the H24, which lead me to believe it might be pretty fresh. Then again... So, the beer pours a peachy orange amber color with excellent head retention and very good lacing. The nose is pretty good as well, as I get some light tropical fruit, celery salt, and dry citrus. The overly sweet tropical fruit had me worried there might be a freshness problem, something that I was even more concerned about on the palate. The beer is fairly sweet, malty and boozy, and had the sort of flavor I tend to associate with an IPA/DIPA that has been sitting around a bit too long. Still, the beer had some pretty decent hoppy bitterness in the finish, that helped to counter the sweetness. Mouthfeel was fairly light otherwise, and the alcoholic bit wasn't too over the top. In the end, I thought this a decent, fairly enjoyable DIPA. Would still like to try a fresher version, as otherwise I'm pretty certain this is a beer I have no need to visit again in the future.  ",4.25,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.63

The color alone turned me off as it was not what I was in the mood for or expect from the style. Smell is faintly sweet, a touch of lemon meringue. There is a faint sweet tart note as well. Taste is more in line with the appearance, with a distinct cocoa note, although there is still that hint of lemon as well. I honestly like the combo, it even suits my mood seasonably, but is nevertheless much maltier than I expect for a maibock. There's a touch of solvent to the alcohol that could stand to be tidied up. Mouthfeel is drying from the alcohol, malty and medium bodied (but lighter than it looks). Drinkability is tricky. Not at all the pale, crisp, herbal mai bock I expected. But the flavor combo of slightly chocolate and lemon, along with the drying body, worked well and went down easily. Still a touch dirty on the fusels, but by and large, a nice beer, if more bock than mai bock. My rating bias was most stylistic for the appearance...  ",,,,,,3.52

Premiere sourness decorates the fruit and brings the most out of them kicking and screaming. Rich in a ruby-mauve dark red cloak, the beer settles in the glass with a slight rouge stained column of foam. Fruit hovers over the rim with hints of plum, cider, raspberry, cranberry and rhubarb. Its sweet early palate is of hard blackberry candy with a mildly creamy fruit center. A beautiful array of flavors spread across the tongue as the jaws tighten and the lips begin to pucker. Plum, blackberry, lime, lemon and white wine vinegar strike the senses with force. Green apple, red grape and balsamic create a sour but savory interplay before a finish of red wine, beet and sour oaken rhubarb. Medium-light on the palate, the savory dark fruits cling to the mouth and promote a lasting impression of sweetness and fruit but the sheer acidity nearly erases all that as its full sour brunt strips the thirst and teases the palate with a seductive tang and tart display. A mild earthen afterglow of oak and cork give a cellar-like aura to the session in the most delightful way possible.  ",4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.3

Aroma is subdued hops, taste is caramel malt with a tiny hops nip at the tail end. Some lingering bitterness on the palate. A good started IPA for someone not used to the style.  ",3.25,3.25,3,3,3,3.08
75475,Tone,2016-08-17,"   Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of strong floral hops, citrus hops, slight hop resin, alcohol, earthy malt, and slight pine. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, hop resin, floral hops, alcohol, earthy malt, slight sweet malt, and pine.

75475,ivantheiceman,2016-01-04,"   The appearance was a nice medium gold color and it was somewhat hazy. When it was poured it has a 1/4inch head and it dissipated pretty quickly. nice hop aroma with some sweet notes in it and a mild fruit hits the nose. The initial taste is also very sweet. Second are notes of bitterness and some tart fruits. I get some grapefruit notes as well. The balance of the beer is very nice, not too hoppy and not too sweet. The mouthfeel is very nice, it feels very bubbly on your tongue. Medium body on the tongue not too thin and not chewy. Overall impression is that it was a very nice beer. Nice balance between sweet and bitter. With the 7.5 alcohol percentage it has no boosey or harsh notes within it. I would rate the beer 3/5 because I would have liked a better hop aroma on the start and again a better hop character throughout.  ",4,2,3,3,3,2.82

75475,vladdswrath,2015-10-24,"   Pours a clear, golden amber. Lightly carbonated and leaves only a small one knuckle head,even after an aggressive pour. Smell is low key, but pleasant; a sweet malt and florals, with just the slightest clip of citrus at the end. In much the way you would expect an IPA to taste, (going sweet and then crashing into burning alcohol and an abrupt snap of bitterness to pull you out of it) the sweet smell is cut off by the citrus aroma that is brief and fades quickly. Taste is full of character, much danker than expected but still sweet and buttery. It feels like it has more carbonation than the pour indicates, but otherwise it is smooth and creamy. I think I like this one a lot more than most, judging by the ratings. This thing is delicious! You guys are nuts...  ",3,3.5,4.25,3.5,4,3.87

75475,TheSixthRing,2015-07-15,"   Appearance - Pours hazy and orange/amber in color with a finger of sandstone head that fizzles quickly, resulting in a near barren, flat surface with a razor thin ring of suds encircling the edge of the glass. Spotty lacing with fair stick. Smell - Heavy caramel malts are obvious; hops come in with a bit of floral and citrus quality. Light lemon-like sourness. Taste - Follows the nose for the most part. Malts are almost too prevalent, as Heavy caramel, hints of butterscotch and a light breadiness can be found thoughout the profile. Hops do push through mid-taste with floral and citrus character to give this a slight hop edge, delivering a bittersweet finish that hits on orange and caramel notes. Mouthfeel - On the heavier side of medium with moderate carbonation. Almost a lightly creamy texture that goes down nice and smooth. Overall - Nothing spectacular or original, but I'm a sucker for caramel heavy IPA's. This one doesn't quite have the bright or aggressive hop profile of other caramel heavy IPA's that I prefer, like say Deschutes Inversion, but it's still a nice, drinkable brew for me. Odd that the bottle I'm drinking says 7.1% ABV while the default picture (and under brew description) says 6.9%; they must have tweaked the recipe at some point.  ",3.25,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75
75475,muchloveforhops3,2015-06-07,"   12oz bottle into pint glass Smooth caramel malt provides a base for piney hop notes; a touch of spice; smooth profile with a pleasant mouthfeel to boot; nothing mind-blowing, but enjoyable While there are more favorable options out there with regard to the style, I agree that the current BA score (78/100) doesn't quite reflect the quality of this particular beer.  ",4,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.89

75475,bilbobrewer,2014-12-10,"   IMO, this beer is a lot better than the reviews here indicate. If I had seen the rating here before buying it, I probably never wouldn't have, which would have been a mistake. I've had some really BAD IPAs that are scored in the high-80s here. Go figure. It isn't a world-beater, but it's true to the style. Pours clear. The head dissipates a little quickly, but the beer leaves a decent lacing on the glass. The nose isn't too hoppy, but the taste is hoppy, resiny, and smooth. Very drinkable...... could see downing 4 or 5 of these quite easily, so at 6.9% abv congrats on that great bit of brewing skill. A good brew, I'd gladly have it again. Good info on the label. A Brewed On or BB date would be a good addition.  ",,,,,,4.25

Small, weak head leaves some lacing and a lasting thin ring. Feel is rather thin, with low but adequate carbonation (cask). Light body is very smooth. The smoothness, and the BB flavoring and aromatics distinguish this from the normal version, which I had again a couple of weeks ago and which I think I like better. There is also a touch of sour I don't remember in the standard version. Still, nice low ABV warmer.  ",,,,,,3.8

Poured at a good temperature with a medium sized, foamy, cream-colored head that soon subsided to a light cover and some lace. Color is a slightly hazy orange amber with some tiny bubble trails. Aroma is hops up front with resin, citrus, spice, malt in the background and a bit of wet cardboard. Flavor's much like nose with tang and hop on top a hint of sweet below. Body/carbonation are perfect. Finish is like flavor, has some significant alcohol warmth, and is quite long. Very drinkable.  ",3.5,3.75,4.25,4.75,4,4.09

75475,mactrail,2013-09-04,"   Amber color in the wine glass with a better than average foamy cap. Sudsy mouthfeel that lasts well. Just a whiff of something like Cascade hops, with the flowery and resiny notes. The first sip is a little underwhelming since the hops are rather shy and it's on the murky side. However, it opens up into a sweet and tangy flavor. A pleasant spicy taste. The bitterness takes a while to appear, but it leaves a nice burn for the finish. Overall this is kind of soft and herbaceous, but then it turns sharper with some mineral flavors and the hoppy bite at the end. If you're expecting a massive hoppiness, this could be considered to be an anemic IPA, but it's a warm and hoppy brew that turns out to be highly drinkable. It's just not a hop blast. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Pioneer Market in La Conner. Not a bad price.  ",4,3.25,3.5,4,3.75,3.57

A foamy white cap rises to a finger high with decent retention. A small ring drops webs of lace. S- General mix of tart producing bacteria cultures with lactic prevailing. Lemon and underripe stone fruit come to mind. T- Basically like the aroma with more stone fruit character like sour apricot. Lactic bacteria and raw grains produce the bulk of the flavor. Raw spelt. Tart rather than sour. MF- Light body and a medium carbonation level. Just a bit of frothy foamy texture and a tart ending. Lactic bugs and a hint of whole grains make for a very solid, sessionable sour but one that could use just a bit more dimension.  ",4,4,4,4,4,4

47658,WesMantooth,2015-04-02,"   I never got to try out of the bottle, but a few times on draft. It has a rich aroma of maple syrup and oak with a touch of coffee and roasted barley. It pretty much delivers on the nose in the flavor. Very authentic, prominent maple syrup that is held in check and restrained from being too rich by the light bitterness from the coffee, which is a smoother, and way more subtle flavor than in FBS or KBS to me. Also lots of roasted malt and some chocolate. The bourbon is hardly noticeable, but there. Body is fairly viscous and hefty, and a tad syrupy. The best maple beer I have had by far, and worthy of the hype.  ",4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.6

No light getting through S: coffee, vanilla, dark fruit, spearmint, bourbon booze, milk chocolate... Really a touch light on aroma but picked up as it warmed. T: much sweeter than I was expecting. The coffee flavor is all throughout but without much bitterness. Maple and vanilla dominate. Bourbon is disguised as applying sweetness without the liquor sting. Complex and flavorful. Nothing off putting and is close to the hype as almost no beer can match the hype like that surrounding this one. M: may be the best part. So silky smooth, perfect degree of coating the palate. No bad aftertaste. Overall: so happy I got to try it. Now that I havr I will likely randomly and unintentionally come accross it a dozen more times.

There is some slight bourbon coming trough with coffee and chocolate. Lots of sweet syrup and spirit going on. The coffee pops really well in the flavor with a big roastiness that lingers with the chocolate and bourbon. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. Drinks really smooth and velvety. Ends a little dry with some sugary stick. Could use a touch more body but that's just being picky. When I first got into beer this was the whale du jour.

Got to try on tap, (edit:now in bottle too and aging one for later, will report back) and wow do the flavors really balance and contribute to a heart warming complexity. The maple barrel is really felt but not overpowering or too sweet, rather it integrates seamlessly with the oat, chocolate, malt, bourbon, molasses, vanilla, and light charred wood. Even with all the ingredients, high abv, and darkness it is still very drinkable.  ",4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75

Little bits of coconut are floating around in the glass. Smell is sweet, vanilla essence is present but does not really smell as such, just sweet. coffee is prevalent and mixes well with the sweet smell. You don't get much coconut in the nose but it is immediately apparent in the taste. Sweet throughout and the vanilla hits you in the back end. The coffee is kind of lost as its own flavor but is mixed perfectly with the other ones. The feel is thick and silky, a bit sticky and clingy. Overall an excellent beer that combines the individual ingredients in to a flawless symphony. Side note: Had it on draft at the release and it was a tad better than the bottled version but only slightly so.  ",4.5,5,5,4.75,4.75,4.9

227065,AtlCarl,2016-08-22,"   Its not often that I bother to review a beer but sometimes you just have an experience with a beer worth talking about and this is one of those. Serving format: bottle pour Glass: snifter Appearance: Exactly what you'd expect from a higher abv stout. Completely opaque, light head quickly dissipating and leaving behind a nice clean lacing. The only flaw I found in this category was what appeared to be a few chunks of coconut in my pour that likely suck through the filtration process. Aroma: Amazing! I could not get my face out of the glass while enjoying this beer. A near perfect meld of adjuncts and chocolate notes masking a rather high alcohol presence being that it is a 15%+ beer Taste: Pure Candy. I said a near perfect meld of adjuncts when describing the aroma, I will go with a perfect meld of adjuncts here. This is one the most balanced adjunct stouts I've ever had. Sweet yet not overwhelmingly so, due to the heavy coffee addition. It really offers layer upon layer of complexity and masks its big alcohol content very well. Mouthfeel: Its a 15%+ stout that drinks at around 12% to 13%. Thick, viscous, and rich but not over powering at all. Overall: Absolutely outstanding beer. I struggle to find anything I didn't enjoy about it and certainly to find a flaw in it. Its exactly what I would like to think it was intended to be, liquid candy.  ",4.5,5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.8

237365,TheBeerCarl,2016-11-27,"   Pours a hazy bright yellow with some orange hues. The head is nice for a sour; it pours full and white but quickly recedes to a thin level of head lining the glass and no lacing. The nose is very light. It has hints of cherry, apples and lemon but not the powerful, tart, brettanomyces nose that this style usually bears. It's a pleasant nose but it doesn't inspire salivation like a good wild ale does. Pleasant and strong flavors of apple and cinnamon with light hints of lemon, sour cherry, and clove. Definitely a nice fall beer. The beer is not tart enough or complex enough in its flavor profile to warrant a great score but it is an okay sour. The beer lacks some carbonation on the palate but the body is nice a and light. The ale is a bit dry but that helps offset the lack of carbonation. Overall this beer is pleasant but nothing great.  ",4.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.71

225776,HattedClassic,2016-07-18,"   The beer pours a nice bubbly head that dissipates very quickly and has a slight purple tinge to it, which is a nice touch and looks pretty. The beer itself has a very nice and appealing color to it. The beer is a nice deep purple that looks like wine and the boysenberry fruit itself. The smell is good. The beer smell has a good brett presence that mixes very well with the sweeter Boysenberry. The smell also has a slight tannin note to it but it gets lost in the brett. The boysenberry gives a nice sweeter taste that resembles more of a plum note and a nice tartness to it as well. The taste is very good. While it has a decent brett presence, it's not as strong as it is in the smell. The boysenberry really shines a lot more in the taste than the smell. It's a lot more juicy and its sweet tartness is more prevalent and present; it's the stronger of the notes. The two different work well together since the brett gives it a nice moderate funkiness to it. The feel is nice. It's a light bodied beer with tingling carbonation. It also has an interesting acidity that you would normally find in wine to it. Overall, it was a pretty good beer and definitely a good wild ale. This is one of the more juicy wild ales I've come across and definitely worth the purchase. Go for it.  ",4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4.23

225776,StonedTrippin,2016-06-12,"   way more intense than the plum version was, this is one heck of a beer from green flash, one of my favorites in the cellar 3 lineup too. its intensely colored, deep violet in the glass, like a dye or something, some soft and lazy pink head on top, but it settles quickly. the nose here is medicinal boysenberries, in a good way. there is a serious tang from both the fruit and the souring cultures, working together, puckery and pungent. the boysenberry is the truest use of this fruit i have ever known in a beer, its tart but also jammy and sweet, they must have used an absolute ton of it. lots of red wine in the flavor and feel, both tannic and bigger in terms of structure. the fruit is so bold, but it also sort of dries out the tongue in the end, like a really concentrated blueberry juicy or something might. dried cherry comes to mind, lemon zest from the lacto, a musty woody funk too, and good acidity without making this undrinkable. carbonation lags a little, but it lets the whole thing linger longer. lots of body and density to this, seemingly all from the fruit, as i dont taste much grain in here. one of the more robustly flavored fruited sours i have come across, deep deep boysenberry flavor, and overall a real work of art. have they bottles any of these natura morta beers?  ",4.5,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,4.34

According to the brewer, ingredients are - Hops: Warrior for bittering, Glacier for the flavor hop addition, Palisades for the aroma addition. Grain bill: Gambrinus Pilsner, Munich malt , two types of crystal malt, small amounts of both roast and chocolate malts and Simpsons Golden Naked Oats. Pours a deep, rich caramel, almost Coca-Cola. Minimal head. Smell is deep, rich malts. Some spiced hops, brown sugar and molasses. Deep hop flavor, but nothing like an IPA. Near perfect balance of big-hop flavor and big malt taste. Good, slightly spiced aftertaste. Hints of chocolate in the roasted malts. Mouthfeel is a little creamy and very smooth. Medium body. Drinkability is high. A comfortable, tasty and balanced winter warmer.  ",,,,,,4

193198,DanfromVan,2016-01-31,"   Poured swiftly into a very large Tempelier Tulip which I got s a Christmas gift Pac and has become my go to beer glass. Nice. Thin head, slight lace, and a rapidly evaporating CO2 structure makes this a quick quaff. There is a thinness to the beer which makes it quite acceptable as a go to sporting beer. If they offered this in the stands of the hockey rink, it would be a huge hit. Light and tasty, with a few hints of dough and candy, but without the 9-11% ABV of a true Belgian and this is good. I am repeatedly stuck with the choice of a lighter rice beer choice at 4.5 ABV or going for a Belgian Blast at 9-11% when I am out socializing. With this beer I am can actually have two bottles before I blow above .08% and get a 30 day driving suspension...So this might become a beer of choice for me to bring when I go out visiting in the rainforest. Lots of breweries advertise a Belgian style, this is one of the few who deliver. As an at home delectable brew, I would likely go a bit stronger with a Grande Reserve 17 or St Bernardus 12 (special order through the BCLCB of a 24 pac for roughly $100.00) Would go again.unfortunately only available through their 24 pac sampler. Love my Belgian dubbels and tripels, so this has echoes of both, without the penalty.  ",4.25,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.23

193198,Bunman3,2015-12-23,"   I was quite excited to see this in the Tree mixer pack I tracked down for the holidays. It's a great name for a style that I'm somewhat undecided about. The look, smell, and taste promise bready sweetness and for the most part, this beer delivers. It is a pleasant brew, one that I will keep around for folks who like to try something a little different.  ",3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.52

91820,biboergosum,2013-11-16,"   330ml bottle. 'He doesn't look a thing like Jesus', especially sporting that port barrel there. Another coup by the Alberta import agent here, it would seem. This beer pours a solid, light-destroying black hole, full-stop, with a skimpy thin cap of equally fizzy and creamy dark beige head, which wisps away, to its credit, in slightly more than a mere moment, leaving a bit of big buck antler lace in spots around the glass as things duly drop away. It smells of bittersweet chocolate, treacle, well-roasted coffee beans, fleshy black fruit - cherry, plum, and fig - woody and musty red wine, a further earthy dustiness, and subtle booze twinges. The taste is more concentrated cocoa nibs, dark baking sugar, molasses, licorice, bitter espresso, dark, gritty fruit, pleasantly softened caramel, vanilla, and hot red wine barrel notes, all well integrated and making nice with each other. The bubbles are quite understated, and even AWOL at times, the body a sticky medium-heavy weight, surprisingly smooth, and creamy by the same metric. It finishes on the sweet side, the big chocolate malt, dark sugar, licorice, and extracted barrel notes seeing little counterpoint, only in the bristling alcohol. Like the label marketing babble essentially says, take a great thing, mess with it, and hopefully make it even better (I'm not going for their 'godlier' angle). Well, at least they haven't screwed up an already heady and deadly tasty beer, they've only added a bit of red wine barrel essence, which actually dials things back a tad, to a degree not noticeable unless you are inclined to put the two offerings side by side. And then, mi amigo, even El Jebus can't help you.  ",4,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.08

Not too bitter...which is kind of nice (actually shared this with my non-beer drinking sister and she very much enjoyed it) Feel: Medium body. Slightly creamy. Overall: A really good IIPA.

A - Hazier than usual , and not quite as bright orange as the others I've had, but the head is beautiful. Tight off-white bubbles that are going absolutely nowhere. N - Hmm, definitely plenty hoppy, but not bitter at all. I get some bright citrus and not a whole lot else. I would prefer a bit stronger, but this is exactly how I like my IPAs to smell. T - Ooooo, very nice. Really not at all bitter. I do get more pine here than I did in the nose, but otherwise plenty of citrus. Not amazingly complex, but a solid all-around IPA. M - Here's where Tree House really shines. Somehow all of these IPAs turn to froth as soon as they hit my tongue, and it's just wonderful. I don't know how they do it. They just know how to craft a good beer. Very wet on the finish, actually, like it's continuously quenching my thirst. Nicely done. O - Another winner.  ",4,4,4,5,4,4.1

91820,corby112,2013-09-13,"   Draft at Tørst in Brooklyn, NY. Pitch black and opaque with a 1.5 finger dark mocha head that has very good retention, only slowly fading into a lasting ring.  Streaks of soapy lacing left behind. Impressive for the style and high ABV. Very vinous with a strong port barrel character along with dark fruit sweetness and dry oak that slightly overpowers the complex malt character of the base beer.  There's still a sweet and roasted malt presence with hints of burnt toast, dark cocoa and robust coffee followed by dessert-like chocolate malt sweetness.  Nice port barrel presence but I prefer the malt crush of the regular version. Full bodied with a strong port barrel presence.  Dry and vinous with lots of toasted oak and sweet, vinous dark fruit flavor.  Lots of grape, dark cherry, currant and other dark berries along with a prominent toast oak flavor.  Underneath, there is a nice balance of roast and silky malt sweetness.  Some smoke along with burnt malt, coffee grinds, oatmeal and bitter cacoa along with sweet chocolate and lactic creaminess.  Pretty complex and the port character gives this beer another dimension but the barrel aging takes away what I like most from the base beer.  Good but not as interesting or flavorful as the regular version.  ",4.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.84

Definitely smells a bit sweeter than the regular version, although this is really nice. T- Pretty similar to the aroma, nice flavors of chocolate, fruit, roast and molasses. The port and oak become especially noticeable towards the finish, where they provide some tasty and rich flavors. M- Full-bodied, low-ish carbonation, has a smooth, thick feel.

Taste is very good. Port, oak, roasted malt, chocolate. The Barrel is strong but cannot overpower the monster that is the base beer. Full bodied, moderate to low carbonation level. Heavy and thick.
